unfortunately, there are a few glitches.
ACL is unhappy about the redefinition of //
it complains about reference to the serror package in
sys-proclaim (seems I can #-allegro comment it out?)
 and I just commented out a function in spgcd
which did some array store bogosity.

I haven't figured out the dumplisp/restart
sequence which for ACL6.0 is slightly different.
You dump only a dll or dxl and then when you
start up, 
you specify this file. When I do, I'll send
an compile-allegro.lisp file out.

It looks like the GCL speed and the Allegro
speed on this problem are fairly close.  Since
GCL is running on a slower machine, the difference
may be in GCL's favor.  (I don't know if WFS
has some GCL-only speedups in use on this task.)

For GCL I was able to run on an 850Mhz Pentium (linux) machine which did not
have other big jobs running, and so the time for execution is
the same as wallclock time (ie elapsed time).

===========

In reference to the compiling under allegro:

   it complains about reference to the serror package in
   sys-proclaim (seems I can #-allegro comment it out?)

Yes certainly #-allegro it.

   You dump only a dll or dxl and then when you
   start up, 
   you specify this file. When I do, I'll send
   an compile-allegro.lisp file out.

Please do!

the powers function is written in lisp in Macsyma (c), and
seems to be in share/  not share2/  directory.  I don't
if it dates back to Maxima days. I don't
know why you would want to use it, because it seems to
have as a feature, the bug that it requires expressions
to be expanded out. You can do rat(expression,x)
and then pick off the leading degree and subtract that term
off, repeatedly, using ratcoeff, or bothcoeff instead.

something like the (untested) program below.

mypowers(r,x):=
 block([ h:hipow(r,x)],
 if h=0 then [] else cons (h, mypowers(second(bothcoeff(r,x^h)),x)
)))

freeofl  takes a list as first argument and ask if, for each element r
of the list L, is e free of r.
I would write it like this..

freeofl(L,e):= if L=[] then true else freeof(first(L),e) and
freeofl(rest(L),e)

I'm not sure what else is needed from the gnauto file though.

Subject: [Maxima] Maxima-5.5-beta and dynamic shared lib links
In-Reply-To: Richard Fateman's message of "Thu, 14 Sep 2000 10:48:57 -0700"
Message-ID: <200104140405.XAA00624@linux34.ma.utexas.edu>

Greetings!  I'm upgrading the Debian maxima package to 5.5-beta, and
am running into the same shared-library link problems as before.  This
time, I've found some time to detail what's going on a bit more
clearly, so hopefully this will help.

I've now produced two saved_maxima executables, one 5.5-beta compiled
with -g, and one using the current cvs trees for gcl and maxima
compiled as per default, both of which run successfully on 3, and
segfault on 4 of our Debian 2.2 "aka potato" boxes, all of which share
an NFS home filesystem.  The problem is the same in all cases:  on
startup,
PRINTstream->sm.sm_object0->s.s_dbind->sm.sm_object1->sm.sm_fp->_fileno 
is correctly set to stdout (1) on the boxes where it works, and
garbage where it segfaults.  The program segfaults when trying to
first write to stdout.  (Actually, the whole sm_fp FILE structure is
bogus.)  

This setup must be preallocated on the stack or some such, as this
condition holds even when breaking in gdb at the address of the first
assembly statement in init of the executable.  Furthermore, on
checking the memory maps loaded by the process, (/proc/<pid>/maps:),
all working cases show the following:

08048000-08485000 r-xp 00000000 03:03 88802      /usr/lib/maxima-5.5/src/saved_maxima_debug

All machines have identical ldso and libc6 packages installed.  

I haven't yet had time to understand the sfaslelf.c and/or rsym_elf.c,
which is where I think this is getting setup.  I would greatly
appreciate suggestions from those much more knowledgeable than me on
this list!  Unfortunately, my test case is not on a public network.  I
haven't yet discovered what aspect of these machines is causing the
different loading, so I cannot guarantee reproducing this situation on
another system, though this behavior does persist on each execution
of saved_maxima here.  Any suggestions of what to try would be most
helpful.  I'm pretty decent with C and a debugger, but don't know
about elf formats, etc.

Thanks!

Greetings!

This works!  Thank you so much!!!

A few (very minor in comparison) other things I've run across in
putting this together:

1.  Can't strip the binary:

intech19:~$ strip saved_maxima
BFD: /fix/g/camm/stp7tlJa: warning: allocated section `.data' not in segment
BFD: /fix/g/camm/stp7tlJa: warning: allocated section `.bss' not in segment

(then segfaults if run)

Is this to be expected?

2. I think ctensr.mac should be named ctensr.mc?  (So that it can
   'load'?)

3. No manpage for xmaxima.  Not a big deal.

Thanks for this wonderful tool!

Is there a Maxima equivalent of Macsyma's  initialization file?  Under
Macsyma the
file is called macsyma-init.macsyma.  In this file, you can set filesearch
and issue
setupautoload statements.   Maxima's info file mentions the initialization
file, but
all my guesses for where to put it and what to call it have failed.

   You can try debian statistics -- Maxima is included in the standard distro

actually the most common platform is probably windows, now that there
is a good self installing windows distribution (reference
http://www.ma.utexas.edu/maxima.html ).  I should put a counter on my
page for downloads, but the thing is these things just get
mirrored--something I would of course encourage not prohibit, so it is
probably not worth the effort.

Message-ID: <200104140409.XAA00686@linux34.ma.utexas.edu>


Thanks for the help with maxima's initialization file.

Using maxima 5.4 under Linux, I've only been able to get maxima to read
init.lsp
if the file is in the working directory. Putting it in /usr/lib/maxima-5.4
or
/usr/lib/maxima-5.4/src didn't work for me.

In the process of creating my init.lsp file, I discovered that maxima's
save function
outputs

    (in-package "maxima"

This needs to be manually changed to

    (in-package "maxima")

To auto-load the function "to_html" located in the file
/home/barton/maxima/mathml4.3.o,  the
following init.lsp file works for me:

;;; -*- mode: lisp; package:maxima; syntax:common-lisp; -*-
(in-package "maxima")

(defprop |$to_html| #"/home/barton/maxima/mathml4.3.o" autoload)
(add2lnc '|$to_html| $props)

This seems to be fixed in the 5.5-beta

These are your own custom functions, right?  Is there a problem with

Subject: [Maxima] prefix operators in maxima 4.5 & 5.5
Message-ID: <200104140409.XAA00696@linux34.ma.utexas.edu>

Defining "curl" to be a prefix operator makes closefile() parse as curl
osefile().  Is there
there a switch that changes this behavior?  Specifically:

(c1) prefix("curl");

(d1) "CURL"

(c2) closefile("buddy.out");

(d2) CURL osefile(buddy.out)

/*  cl is also a prefix operator */

(c3) cl x;

(c3)  CURL x

(I've been playing with maxima's vector packages.  I may adopt it as a
summer programming project.)

Barton Willis

Thank you for reporting this bug.    It would appear to have been
there for sometime, with people not using more than 2 character prefix


    (c1) prefix("curl");

    (d1) "CURL"

    (c2) closefile("buddy.out");

    (d2) CURL osefile(buddy.out)

the code of read-command-token-aux in nparse.lisp as follows:

At the end it was a problem in the omplotdata file, for recent
distributions of Tcl-Tk the file wish8.0 doesn't exist anymore. In order
to use omplotdata  it is enough to change wish8.0 wish

Subject: maxima: missing trigrat.lisp
Package: maxima
Version: 5.5-beta-4
Severity: normal


Greetings, and thank you for your report.  I'm submitting this to the
Debian Bug tracking system on your behalf to better keep track of this
issue.  In general, there are many files in the source package which
are not installed by default in the makefiles, and it appears that the
installed list has gotten out of date with respect to the
documentation.  I'm also ccing this message to the maxima list to
enquire as to whether it would be better to delete the reference to
trigrat from the documentation, or to include it in the installation.

Dr. Schelter, this issue has come up before with the mactex.lisp file
in src/, and I just installed it by hand.  Is there a general wildcard
file pattern specifying files that we could *safely* install and cover
any references in the existing documentation?

Thanks!

Subject: maxima: missing trigrat.lisp
Package: maxima
Version: 5.5-beta-4
Severity: normal


Greetings, and thank you for your report.  I'm submitting this to the
Debian Bug tracking system on your behalf to better keep track of this
issue.  In general, there are many files in the source package which
are not installed by default in the makefiles, and it appears that the
installed list has gotten out of date with respect to the
documentation.  I'm also ccing this message to the maxima list to
enquire as to whether it would be better to delete the reference to
trigrat from the documentation, or to include it in the installation.

Dr. Schelter, this issue has come up before with the mactex.lisp file
in src/, and I just installed it by hand.  Is there a general wildcard
file pattern specifying files that we could *safely* install and cover
any references in the existing documentation?

Thanks!

I would hope that the autoloading capability of the system
would take care of all of the "out-of-core" files if the
autoload properties were set up and the file names and locations
were correct.
  I know of no way to assure that the different files
do not tread on each others' toes, though there would probably
be warning messages for overlaying already-existing program
definitions.  
  Of some interest: trigrat is NOT in the commercial macsyma,
though I suspect the short file could, with a little
effort,  be loaded into it.  I tried it and the reader-dispatch
marker #$  to use the maxima reader  does not work in macsyma.

I'm also cc'ing Bill Gosper in case he wants to know that
there are actually people fussing with the public domain
maxima.

marker #$  to use the maxima reader  does not work in macsyma.

I'm also cc'ing Bill Gosper in case he wants to know that
there are actually people fussing with the public domain
maxima.

Camm,

Thanks for the prompt reply,

I have an extra remark.

I did notice also that the debian package does not depend upon the gcl
debian package. I dont know if this is implicitly compiled with gcl or
not. Maybe "debianized" maxima should "suggest" gcl ?

About trigrat again. I find this file quite important. It is a
differential relative to other simplifications in trigonometric methods.
Simply ignore it in the documentation appears to me as a not good idea.


Thanks again,

Daniel

Message-ID: <200104140412.XAA00754@linux34.ma.utexas.edu>

Thank you for the report.   I have corrected this in the current
version, as reflected on the cvs site.

and have added the following chages:
2001-04-06  Bill Schelter  <wfs at sonia.ma.utexas.edu>

	* Fix the install to install all share/*.lisp
	* Fix auto-mexpr which had a bug, but only seen
	with 'trigrat'
	* Fix file_search to also look for .lisp in share/*


Meanwhile you can download the file trigrat.lisp from the cvs pages:

wget 'http://cvs.ma.utexas.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/maxima/share/trigrat.lisp?rev=1.2&content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=maxima' -O trigrat.lisp

Hi,

I just tried a cmulisp-compile with the cvs HEAD version of maxima. The
files cmulisp-regex.lisp and cl-info.lisp are missing. Were they
inadvertently omitted from the cvs commit?

Thanks,

I have just added the couple of cmulisp files by

Greetings!  I also just noticed the cmulisp work.  What is the plan?
Is work on gcl going to continue, or will it be replaced by cmulisp?
Or will one have the option of either?  Is there an advantage to one
or the other?  I only ask as to avoid any work on porting gcl to
different architectures if it is likely to be replaced soon.

Take care,

The Debian package does a subbuild on gcl when building maxima.  My
understanding is that there is no further run-time dependance on gcl.

The Debian package does a subbuild on gcl when building maxima.  My
understanding is that there is no further run-time dependance on gcl.

Subject: [Maxima] Re: recent cmulisp commits to cvs
Message-ID: <200104140415.XAA00847@linux34.ma.utexas.edu>




   Greetings!  I also just noticed the cmulisp work.  What is the plan?
   Is work on gcl going to continue, or will it be replaced by cmulisp?
   Or will one have the option of either?  Is there an advantage to one

The work on GCL will definitely continue, and I feel (perhaps biased
of course) that GCL is the best for maxima if it is available on the
platform.  Having full control over GCL we are guaranteed that it will
not change in ways undesirable for Maxima, and that it can be
optimized for it.  I know GCL does not have any memory leaks, and it
is used in industry for example by the program verification, chip
verification people for doing things like proving the AMD k7 floating
point unit correct.  This involved computations taking weeks to run on
powerful processors.  GCL is faster on their programs and reliable.
GCL runs the basic tests in maxima about 3 times as fast as Clisp.
The latter is a very good lisp, but if gcl runs on the platform I
would prefer it.  Personally I need the ability to single step line by
line at the lisp level in debugging maxima at the lisp level, and I
know how to do that in GCL (having written the code myself!), whereas
I will never be as competent in someone else's lisp.

However, that said, I think it is good to maintain compatibility with
other lisps, so that people can use features or platforms that may be
unique to those lisps, and I am very happy to see people contributing
patches and making sure it does run elsewhere.

   And thank you for the quick fixes!  They're now incorporated and
   uploaded in the Debian package.  

Thank YOU for making the debian package so up to date!!

And in answer to someone else's question, maxima once built
under gcl does not depend on gcl being on the system.

Many thanks for all. It is the first time I send a bug report to Debian

Thank you all. I am porting a program originally in Mathematica to Maxima

It would be good to keep track of the things you had to
do in the conversion so that we can put together
a FAQ on "how do I convert my mathematica program to maxima".

Richard,

Thank you for the sugggestion.

I will do my best for it. If in the next 4 months you receive nothing: I
failed, and you can send my best wishes to Stephen Wolfram  :) 

Speaking more seriously I have with me a small group that works a lot
with mathematica and if could do the job with one program I will need
to convince them after all. In the meantime I will be forced to keep notes
of the job. If the work seems to be fruitful I will even start to learn
LISP ...

Is there a Maxima equivalent of Macsyma's  initialization file?  Under
Macsyma the
file is called macsyma-init.macsyma.  In this file, you can set filesearch
and issue
setupautoload statements.   Maxima's info file mentions the initialization
file, but
all my guesses for where to put it and what to call it have failed.

Thanks for the help with maxima's initialization file.

Using maxima 5.4 under Linux, I've only been able to get maxima to read
init.lsp
if the file is in the working directory. Putting it in /usr/lib/maxima-5.4
or
/usr/lib/maxima-5.4/src didn't work for me.

In the process of creating my init.lsp file, I discovered that maxima's
save function
outputs

    (in-package "maxima"

This needs to be manually changed to

    (in-package "maxima")

To auto-load the function "to_html" located in the file
/home/barton/maxima/mathml4.3.o,  the
following init.lsp file works for me:

;;; -*- mode: lisp; package:maxima; syntax:common-lisp; -*-
(in-package "maxima")

(defprop |$to_html| #"/home/barton/maxima/mathml4.3.o" autoload)

Defining "curl" to be a prefix operator makes closefile() parse as curl
osefile().  Is there
there a switch that changes this behavior?  Specifically:

(c1) prefix("curl");

(d1) "CURL"

(c2) closefile("buddy.out");

(d2) CURL osefile(buddy.out)

/*  cl is also a prefix operator */

(c3) cl x;

(c3)  CURL x

(I've been playing with maxima's vector packages.  I may adopt it as a
summer programming project.)

Subject: [Maxima] Newbie problem: plotting with maxima
Message-ID: <200104140418.XAA00921@linux34.ma.utexas.edu>

Dear maxima users

I am trying to start using maxima. After I compiled gcl-2.3.8 and
maxima-5.4 I am trying to get some plots. But when I tried something
like:

plot2d(sin(x),[x,-5,5]);

or

plot3d(2^(-u^2+v^2),[u,-5,5],[v,-7,7]);

the screen is completely full of data but any graphic appear. I thought
that maxima had the possibility to use Tcl/tk in order to plot graphics
on the screen, but it doesn't work for me. What am i doing wrong ? 

I tested gcl (tcl-tk) doing 

> (si::tkconnect)
> (load "/usr/local/lib/gcl-2.3.8/gcl-tk/demos/widget.lisp")


and it worked pretty well. I have in my linux box:

tcl-8.3.2-4mdk
tk-8.3.2-4mdk
tclx-8.3.2-4mdk                                                                 

How can I get plots from maxima ? For me, it is not necessary to use an
interface it would be suficient enough to produce gnuplot format output,
or whatever it was.

Please reply directly the answers to me because I am not subscribe to
this list.
Thank you in advance for your help.

Hi,

I just tried a cmulisp-compile with the cvs HEAD version of maxima. The
files cmulisp-regex.lisp and cl-info.lisp are missing. Were they
inadvertently omitted from the cvs commit?

Thanks,
Jim

For GCL I was able to run on an 850Mhz Pentium (linux) machine which did not
have other big jobs running, and so the time for execution is
the same as wallclock time (ie elapsed time).

===========

In reference to the compiling under allegro:

   it complains about reference to the serror package in
   sys-proclaim (seems I can #-allegro comment it out?)

Yes certainly #-allegro it.

   You dump only a dll or dxl and then when you
   start up, 
   you specify this file. When I do, I'll send
   an compile-allegro.lisp file out.

Please do!

   Greetings!  I also just noticed the cmulisp work.  What is the plan?
   Is work on gcl going to continue, or will it be replaced by cmulisp?
   Or will one have the option of either?  Is there an advantage to one

The work on GCL will definitely continue, and I feel (perhaps biased
of course) that GCL is the best for maxima if it is available on the
platform.  Having full control over GCL we are guaranteed that it will
not change in ways undesirable for Maxima, and that it can be
optimized for it.  I know GCL does not have any memory leaks, and it
is used in industry for example by the program verification, chip
verification people for doing things like proving the AMD k7 floating
point unit correct.  This involved computations taking weeks to run on
powerful processors.  GCL is faster on their programs and reliable.
GCL runs the basic tests in maxima about 3 times as fast as Clisp.
The latter is a very good lisp, but if gcl runs on the platform I
would prefer it.  Personally I need the ability to single step line by
line at the lisp level in debugging maxima at the lisp level, and I
know how to do that in GCL (having written the code myself!), whereas
I will never be as competent in someone else's lisp.

However, that said, I think it is good to maintain compatibility with
other lisps, so that people can use features or platforms that may be
unique to those lisps, and I am very happy to see people contributing
patches and making sure it does run elsewhere.

   And thank you for the quick fixes!  They're now incorporated and
   uploaded in the Debian package.  

Thank YOU for making the debian package so up to date!!

And in answer to someone else's question, maxima once built
under gcl does not depend on gcl being on the system.

Fateman asks:
   GCL looks to be pretty fast there!

   Is there any c-code for the polynomial/rational function
   stuff in Maxima?  (In the original code I think

There is c code for ctimes, cplus, and cmod (the integer parts of
polynomial times), which is put on as an optimizer.  I just tried an
experiment of removing that code and just putting in the standard
common lisp function proclamations as in sys-proclaim.lisp.

The time went from 2.81 seconds to 2.94 seconds (both were elapsed
time = run time since machine was unloaded), so I guess the
optimizations help a little bit (4.4%).  When I originally wrote the C
versions [many years ago!], I had not yet implemented the very fast
function calling of functions with a fixed number of arguments in GCL,
which required my garbage collection of the C stack in GCL etc: Such
functions now compile to c functions of the same number of arguments
and the calls are made via the c stack or via registers depending on
the compiler, and so they are fast, with the only overhead over
regular C being one memory look up since the function call is of the
form (*faddr)(a,b,c) instead of f(a,b,c).  Basically there is not much
you can do in C that you can't do in lisp if you understand the
compiler..  Of course since I was the one who did the original version
of gcc for the x86, I do understand both the lisp and c compilers
which of course is one reason I personally like the
maxima->gcl->gcc->assembler chain!    Of course our bignum code
is still not so optimal, when I was redoing the bignum code of GCL
last time the good GNU mp bignum code did not exist.    Also the
ability of gcc to handle long long 's did not exist.   So there is
definitely room for improvement.

Message-ID: <XFMail.010415100111.daniel.duparc@libertysurf.fr>

I just began to run my favorite tests for 
computer algebra systems in maxima 5.5 beta3, after
having tried: 
(a+b+c+d+1)^35
on my linux box
(amd k6-2 at 300 MHz, 256 MB ram, 
512 MB swap, Mandrake 7.1): 21 seconds.

(By the way, 
1. Maple V.5.1 cannot do the job:
   Error, (in expand/bigpow)
   object too large
      3,869
2. MuPAD 2.0 succeeds in 401s after
   _at least_ one reinitialization of the kernel
   (doubling the stack for pari?)
3. pari/gp 2.1 succeeds in 97s with a big initial stack
)

The problem:
------------
I am very confused by the result of
integrate(1/(1+x^5+x),x);
which is, in my opinion, false and very strange, without
any warning.

The code for rational function integration in Maxima has been
replaced in the commercial macsyma.  Basically, if the denominator
of the rational fraction does not factor over the integers,
then newer solution methods have been discovered. These are
actually kind of clumsy with  sum over "rootof" expressions,  but
the answer is formally correct. Mupad uses these methods.

There are other, probably better for many users, ways for expressing the
answer.. e.g. finding approximate roots in the complex plane
in this case (where the denominator has no extra parameters).

If the derivative doesn't come back with the same answer,
after simplification, then there may also be a bug in
the procedures.

*  I have made some changes to Maxima to handle the integrals
with irreducible factors, see below.

*  Also I have changed GCL to compile Maxima on optimize, so that the
test now takes 2.46 seconds rather than 2.81 as previously stated..

with sufficient space allocated]

(C1)(showtime:all, ratsimp((a+b+c+d+1)^35),1)$
Evaluation took 2.46 seconds (2.49 elapsed)

======
Details about the integration change:

I have added a switch so that the integration in the term
of sum over the roots of the denominator, will be enabled.
Below is a sample call.    This is in the latest snapshot.
One needs several files to bring this uptodate including sinint,
displa, and some others..

(C3) describe(rootso);

 - Variable: INTEGRATE_USE_ROOTSOF
     default: [false] If not false then when the denominator of an
     rational function cannot be factored, we give the integral in a
     form which is a sum over the roots of the denominator:

          (C4) integrate(1/(1+x+x^5),x);
          
                /	 2
                [ x  - 4 x + 5

          	      7		        14	       7 SQRT(3)
     but now we set the flag to be true and the first part of the
     integral will undergo further simplification.
          (C5) INTEGRATE_USE_ROOTSOF:true;
          
          (D5) 			      TRUE

          (C6) integrate(1/(1+x+x^5),x);
          
               ====	 2
               \	     (%R1  - 4 %R1 + 5) LOG(x - %R1)
                >	     -------------------------------
               /			  2
               ====	     3 %R1  - 2 %R1
          		     3	  2
               %R1 in ROOTSOF(x  - x  + 1)
          (D6) ----------------------------------------------------------
          	      7
          
          							 2 x + 1

          				      14	     7 SQRT(3)
          (C7)

     Note that it may be that we want to approximate the roots in the
     complex plane, and then provide the function factored, since we
     will then be able to group the roots and their complex conjugates,
     so as to give a better answer.

The time tends to increase, but it's now much faster when I allocated more
space as Bill suggested.

The C compiler is egcs-2.91.66 but I'm not quite sure how much that
actually makes difference.

Subject: [Maxima] speed testing: Allegro vs GCL
References: <XFMail.010415181742.dduparc@club-internet.fr> <3AD9D556.A20352DE@cs.berkeley.edu>

A better test for Maxima speed, if you are
concerned with the speed of polynomial and
rational function manipulation, may be this:

(showtime:all, rat( (a+b+c+d+1)^35), 1)$

note that instead of doing ratsimp, we are
doing rat.

 What ratsimp does is take the result of
the tightly encoded polynomial result of rat and
conses up an algebraic tree, in macsyma's
"general form".
This does a sorting / ordering kind of
operation which is rather expensive. 
In particular, I just tried using MAXIMA source on
Allegro CL on a 933 Mhz machine. rat alone takes
about 0.94 seconds.

(the commercial macsyma takes 1.2 sec + another 7.5 in 
garbage collection).

Doing the RATSIMP takes 4.65 seconds.

The Allegro profiler (is there one for GCL?)

gives this information, which shows that the largest
single user of computer time is the
8% of the time in the RATSIMP taken within the
function MEMQ.

See below for more info:

So a good place to try to improve this code is
either in making kf_bignum_multiply  faster, [or to
eliminate calls to it].  Another place is pzerop.
This is defined as
(defun pzerop (x) (and (numberp x) (zerop x)))
which suggests it could 
 (a) be done in-line  and/or
 (b) done faster e.g.  (defun pzerop(x)(equalp x 0))

It is plausible that PCTIMES and PTIMES are
taking a lot of time:  PCTIMES multiplies
a polynomial by a coefficient (which could
be a polynomial in other variables), and
PTIMES.  CTIMES and CPLUS are in there, but
not as big contributors.

While I can't speak for maxima itself, I plan to make the necessary
changes to get maxima to run on cmulisp.  In fact, I've just sent
(privately, since I wasn't on this list until just now) a set of
patches (done by Fred Gilham and me) that lets cmulisp run all of the
tests correctly.  cmulisp can now also do plotting via the openmath
plotting option.

Also, since gcl runs on far more platforms than cmulisp, I hope gcl
continues so that maxima continues.

Message-ID: <XFMail.010420123326.dduparc@club-internet.fr>

Dear friends of maxima,

The use of maxima under xemacs is quite comfortable.
However, I tried xmaxima 5.5 and found it beautiful.

I tried to change the dimensions of the window,
but failed miserably : I'm just a beginner in Tkl/Tk.

However I found the following :
- the A4 format (used in Europe) is 21cm x 29.7cm,
  that is 8.2777" x 11.6929", not, of course 8" x11"
- in line 11916, the preferences file is spelled "~/xmaxina.ini"
  and not "~/xmaxima.ini".
  (In my opinion, "~/.xmaxima.ini" would be preferable,
   preventing any deleting by mistake)
- also, for the moment, there is no other option than the font size.
  Can _a user_ add other preferences, and how?
 
Best regards.

Subject: [Maxima] CMUCL problems with yesterdays sources
Message-ID: <4nitjzelkr.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

I grabbed yesterdays sources and there are a few problems.  

o First, it fails in rtest3a with trying to eval some ill-formed
  expression.  The changes looked fairly minimal, but I think the
  problem is in mstuff.lisp.  The definition of mfunction1 changed.
  If I change it back to the original, that error doesn't occur
  anymore.

o The following patch is required.  Otherwise problems 2 and 5 of
  rtest1a returns 0 where FALSE is expected.

o A typo in compile-cmulisp:  (setq *init-run*) should probably be
  (setq *init-run* t).

o In generr.lisp, the errset macro used for clisp can also be used for
  CMUCL.  If not, then errcatch doesn't catch errors as desired.
  (Note:  If you change generr, the files that use errset don't get
  recompiled by make.  I think they should.)

o Finally, a more serious problem.  Problems 6 and 23 in rtest6a
  are wrong.  For problem 23, the expected answer is abs(y).  However,
  I get just plain y.  Similarly in problem 23, the abs is missing.

  For some reason radexpand is ALL instead of TRUE.  (Note:  the
  documentation for SQRT is wrong.  It says if RADEXPAND is TRUE,
  sqrt(x^2) is x.  This only happens if RADEXPAND is ALL.)

With these minor changes, all of the tests pass on CMUCL, except for
the last noted problem.  These go away too if RADEXPAND is set to
TRUE.

All the tests are now ok under gcl and clisp.   Also the source level
debugging (which had temporarily been broken by a clisp patch), does
now work under both gcl and clisp.    All the emacs files such as
dbl.el, smart-complete.el, sshell.el are also now in the maxima
distribution as well as the gcl distribution, since people using clisp
or cmulisp would also need them if they want the source level
debugging under emacs.   I have also updated the documentation on
that (as well as a number of other things).  

The changes are in the cvs and also the daily snapshot has been
updated.

Subject: [Maxima] Documentation for Emacs Maxima mode
Message-ID: <3AE09A31.A358819A@users.sourceforge.net>

Hello,

I have written some 'complete idiot's guide to Maxima-mode in Emacs'
(don't laugh, it took me hours to figure that out). I thought I'd better
ask first for comments before announcing it to the public.

Have a look at
http://symaxx.sourceforge.net/MaximaMode_in_Emacs.html
and tell me, what you think. I know almost nothing about Emacs, so
please correct me if I'm wrong or there is an easier way.
I was planning to post the link on sci.math.symbolic at some time.

Regards

Markus

Ok.  Couple of problems.

Subject: [Maxima] 3d plotting of a matrix
Message-ID: <3AE1803D.81AD9F2F@DResearch.de>

How can I perform ``plot3d()'' of a matrix?
I need to get the plot of a 3d-grid (surface) defined by a matrix in which
elements represent Z-coordinates for 3d-grid nodes.
I tried the way described below:

M:MATRIX([1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4],[1,2,3,4])$
plot3d(M[x][y],[x,1,4],[y,1,4],['grid,4,4]);

But I got the error message from the Maxima in which it said that the ``x''
and ``y'' in the ``M[x][y]'' expression must be integers. That's right, but I
can not find a function that converts float numbers to integer ones.
I also tried to fool the Maxima by typing something like this:

plot3d(M[?truncate(x)][?truncate(y)],...);

but got the error message about my ``x'' and ``y'' are not floats (but what
they are if they aren't integers too?). The straightforward way to fix this:

plot3d(M[?truncate(FLOAT(x))][?truncate(FLOAT(y))],...);

produces the same error message :(

Any solution out there?
Thanks a lot for any help...

P.S.
I think my problem is enough foolish, but I'm C/C++/asm programmer and these
implicit dynamical type convertion tricks produce the cold sweat on my
forehead ;)

Somewhat off-topic, but if you are writing a DE final examination this
weekend,  you may
enjoy  the short Maxima program:

gen_de(sol, dvar, ivar, const) := block([de ],
     sol : [sol, diff(sol,ivar),diff(sol,ivar,2)],
     de : eliminate(sol, const),
     de : solve(de, diff(dvar,ivar,2)),
    ratsimp(first(de))
)$

(c1) depends(y,x)$

(c2) gen_de(y=k1*(x+x^3)*x^(-3/2) + k2 * x*x^(-3/2),y,x,[k1, k2]);

(c3) 'diff(y,x,2) = 3*y/(4*x^2)

(c4) latex(%);

$$ \frac {d^{2} y}{d x^{2}}=\frac {3\,y}{4\,x^{2}} $$

Wunderbar.   To me Maxima is fun, but it also about doing real work quickly and accurately.
For all the folks that have made this possible, I thank you.

   plot3d(M[x][y],[x,1,4],[y,1,4],['grid,4,4]);

I think the easiest thing to do is to define a function f, which is
what you want to plot: ie f(x,y) == z where the z is what you want:

  f(x,y):=float(M[?round(x),?round(y)])$
  plot3d(f,[x,1,4],[y,1,4],['grid,4,4]);

then plot3d works ok.  The problem with putting random forms in as the
first argument of plot3d, is that plot3d evaluates its arguments,
[perhaps it should not but it does..].
And it is not happy evaluating ?round(x) until that has a value..
Note also while M[1][2] will work, M[1,2] will probably be more
efficient not that that matters too much here..

Subject: [Maxima] PC maxima - WRITEFILE
Message-ID: <3AE4221D.9A02780B@protherics.com>

I recently downloaded the PC version of maxima and have been having a
lot of fun playing with it.
I used to use Macsyma, many years ago, so it was good to remeber some of
that stuff.

However, I do not seem to be able to get WRITEFILE to work.

If I submit a series of commands like:
WRITEFILE("TRANSCRIPT");
x: a + b;
CLOSEFILE();

then maxima creates a file called TRANSCRIPT, but it is empty.

Is this a known weakness of the PC distribution or am I missing
something.

Thanks for your help

Message-ID: <XFMail.010424202402.dduparc@club-internet.fr>

A (partial) answer to a question I asked,
for persons with the same problem (if any?):

The option "-geometry" seems not to work
(or I invoke bad parameters?
xmaxima -geometry 950x700
(then, an order 
puts "${width}x${height}"
before the dsetq of line 12007
gives an error message).

These lines around 12007 automaticaly set width and height
to a maximum, which are a bit too big for me.

So, a not so bad workaround to get useful geometry
is to write
geometry . 950x700+10+30
instead of 
geometry . "${width}x${height}"

Best regards.

Only think I noticed that you are using <control-alt-a> notation, where
emacs would simply say C-M-a. As you are explaining what to press at
the beggining, anyway, you should probably use emacs notation.

I have made a few changes to the printing of bignums in maxima so it
now handles the 10000! ok.  (see cvs or snapshots).

Still as I said before the GCL bignum code is not so good, since the
10000! takes 5 seconds on a pentium 850mhz, and another 5 seconds to
print (with GCL).  The maxima CLISP time (using GMP bignum code) is MUCH
faster (0.12 seconds to compute it) with printing taking 3 seconds.

I will look into putting the GMP bignum code into GCL as well.

Also the xmaxima is mostly working in clisp and cmulisp now.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0104271416260.1090-100000@s-inf-pc24.oulu.fi>

I made a while back GNU readline support for GCL-2.3 and all programs
using GCL like Maxima. Back then I needed to link readline statically, and
it worked fine.

Now I'm porting the patch to GCL-2.3.8 and it seems that readline gets
linked dynamically just fine. Nevertheless, it seems that my code in GCL
gets linked in "statically"--which means that my initialization routine,
which initializes Readline variables, gets called only while GCL is being
compiled. But when the user later actually runs GCL, the readline
variables are resetted and it doesn't work.

So, I should ensure that some C-function would be called when GCL is
actually run, after compilation. stracing saved_maxima it seems that it
might run "init.lsp" at the startup. So I could register a C function
as a LISP command and call my initialization routine from
init.lsp. However this might not be ideal solution, since it wouldn't be
transparent to GCL user.

How could I trigger my C function at Maxima load time (instead of compile
time)?

Bugs:

1) Maxima's (gcl / maxima 5.5 and 5.4) abs and cabs functions need some
work:

(C1) display2d : false$
(C2) cabs(%i + log(1+%i));
(D2) SQRT(LOG(2)^2/4+1)
(C3) cabs(rectform(%i + log(1+%i)));
(D3) SQRT(LOG(2)^2/4+(%PI/4+1)^2)

/*  (D3) is correct and (D2) isn't. */

Maxima 5.5 is missing the eigenvalue code, but Maxima 5.4 has it.  Under 5.4, I get
another problem with cabs:

(c1) tee[i,j] := if(i=j) then %i-2 else if (abs(i-j)=1) then 1 else 0$
(c2) m : genmatrix(tee,4,4)$
(c3) cabs(first(first(eigenvalues(m))));

 This above gives an error about "SIGN called on ... (I'm connected to my NT machine
now and I don't remember the exact error.  Sorry.)

2)  A bug with  trigreduce:

(C11) trigreduce(cos(2*atan(8/5)/3));

(Incidentally, isn't "signaled" the correct spelling? Lotus Notes seems to think so.)

3) Might a bug or might be a feature, but float doesn't evaluate %pi to a float while bfloat does:

(D15) %PI

(C17) float(%e);

(Under Macsyma 422, float(%pi) and float(%e) both evaluate to floats.)

Hello,

I'm a newbie in maxima.
I would like to use Hermite Polynomials.
It seems from documentation that they are incuded in the specint
package (%HE).
But I have not be able to obtaine them ...

Any hints ?

Thanks a lot,

ps: I use the potato .deb version of maxima

Code for Hermite polynomials (along with about 15 other orthogonal
polynomials) is  in the specfun package.  I contributed this package in
mid-April, so unless your maxima
is very recent, you won't have it.   You can download specfun.mc from the
maxima CVS at

http://cvs.ma.utexas.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/maxima/share/?cvsroot=maxima

Copy specfun.mc to the maxima share directory.  For best performance, compile specfun.
To use it, try

(C4) load("specfun")$
(C5) display2d : false$
(C6) makelist(hermite(i,x),i,0,3);
(D6) [1,2*x,-2*(1-2*x^2),-12*x*(1-2*x^2/3)]

Let me know if you have any problems.

Since contributing specfun, I've made a few improvements to it (improved
the gradef
statements and sped up the spherical harmonic function).  I'll send the
newest version to anybody that wants it (it's small -- about 20K).  My
package also has two demonstration programs -- variational method in
quantum mechanics and a first order degenerate pertubational calculation
for the Stark effect.

I have Hermite polynomials in version 5.5-beta3. 
You have to load the package

	"specfun"

and use them via

    hermite(n,x)

where I suppose (I do not know for sure) 'n' is a number and 'x' is
a variable.

  Sorry but I do not know those polynomials... :-) so maybe this is
not what you are looking for.

I have finally gotten around to adding much better bignum code to GCL.
So now 10000!  takes .074 seconds.  It is now sufficiently fast
that I have to do a loop 10 times to get a better measurement.
This is a factor of 70 improvement over the 5 seconds it used to
take... The times are on a 900Mhz pentium III.     

I have just put out gcl 2.4.0 and maxima 5.6

Please let me know of problems in compiling this.  I have not yet put
out a windows binary of the above, because of shell/configure problems
in compiling under mingw.

Incidentally the printing is much improved too.   

(c1) :lisp (si::allocate-contiguous-pages 3000 t) (si::allocate 'cfun 300 t) (si::allocate 'fixnum 200 t)
(C8) for i:1 thru 10 do 10000!;
Evaluation took 0.74 seconds (0.76 elapsed)
(D8)

[ note I still am not allocating much space by default, probably
should do more.   Also the bignum space is currently allocated as
contiguous blocks, but I should make it relocatable, but cannot track
down a couple of bugs preventing me from doing so]

Thank you, Bill, for your magnificent work.
The 2 programs compiled without any problem
under Linux Mandrake 7.1.

Incidentally, 10000! is computed and printed without any call of
:lisp(si ... etc... in maxima 5.6 on my machine
(roughly as fastly as under pari/gp 2.1.1).

However I tried to compute one more time (1+a+b+c+d)^35,
and interrupted maxima twice. Then I noticed that
there were 2 copies of saved-maxima in memory, computing
hard (98% of  CPU time). Is this a feature or a bug ;-)?

In File->Preferences
Where it asks
Should plot windows be embedded ?
click on embedded and change it to one of the other defaults:

   separate  means it will reuse one external popup window
   multiple  means it will make a new window for each plot.

You should be able to then save your preferences.   Then you should
reboot windows -- no just kidding..!

This may not be in older versions of xmaxima/netmath

Yes you need a newer version of xmaxima.   You should be able to get it from the
cvs server:

wget http://cvs.ma.utexas.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/maxima/bin/xmaxima?rev=1.3&content-type=text/plain&cvsroot=maxima  --output-document=xmaxima

I cant be sure it will be compatible with the maxima binary you have,
but it probably is.    You need to set an environment variable to tell
xmaxima which maxima executable to use, ie where the root maxima
directory is eg under unix:

export MAXIMA_DIRECTORY=/home/wfs/maxima-5.6
xmaxima

Note if you are running the clisp version of maxima you would use the
same as the above but do

xmaxima -lisp clisp

this last will certainly only work with maxima 5.6.

I have a couple questions about the plot window.   
The reason I ask is eventually (when I both figure out
how and have time) I hope to create a GTK-Perl based
interface to maxima (the embryonic beginnings of this
are on sourceforge at
http://mathshield.sourceforge.net) using MathML and a
notebook style interface.  At some point I'm hoping to
embed the plot window in the notebook.  Is the
embedding ability specific to TCL, or could it
theoretically be done with other toolkits?  Will I
need to do some lower level coding to avoid dependance
on TCL in the plot window itself? 
(http://mathshield.sourceforge.net/concept2.png is a
rough idea of where I hope to go eventually with this
- the screenshots section shows a little more of the
current interface idea if anyone is interested.)

Thanks for your tremendous work on all of this by the
way.  Maxima is one of the coolest software programs
I've seen in a long time.  

Oh, inexperienced newbie question.  Does anyone know
how the feature sets of Octave and Maxima compare? I
don't have enough experience with Octave to know. 
Anyone worked with them enough to make a comparison?

One thing you might look at is the TeXmacs.   Maxima has an interface
with that, which is interesting.   Needs some work, but it does
typesetting of the math.   I also will be putting an interface into
xmaxima that displays properly typeset output.	  

Displaying a plot window inside another application is easy enough:

If you are doing it under X windows at least then for example
do
xwininfo 
to find the id of the window you are interested in.
suppose it has id  0x100001a

% wish -use 0x100001a -f foo.tcl
where
foo.tcl is
=======
label .l -text {hello world}
pack .l
=====
will put that window into the one you specified which perhaps
belongs to another application.   The plotting stuff is all in
the files: plotting.tcl
In the xmaxima.tcl you want the stuff starting at
## source plotting.tcl
down to
## endsource plotting.tcl


       -use id                                                          
       Specifies that the main window for the 
       application is to be embedded  in  the 
       window whose identifier is id, instead 
       of being  created  as  an  independent 
       toplevel window.  Id must be specified 
       in the same way as the value  for  the 
       -use option for toplevel widgets (i.e. 
       it has a form like  that  returned  by 
       the winfo id command).

Although it is sometimes considered impolite to question
why people are programming up anything, I can't resist
asking you why you are doing this. In particular, why
are you using MathML, which so far as I can tell is
quite unsuitable for this purpose.  For example, how do you encode
"interrupt the computation"?
How do you encode a macsyma program as MathML, except
perhaps as a text string, in which case, what's the point?

Octave is a clone of Matlab. Essentially, it does
"numbers".  Maxima does "symbols" which as a special
case, does "numbers".

As far as I know, one can compute 10000! and even 50000! by
assigning more memory to bignums:
:lisp(si::multiply-bignum-stack 100)
lets one compute 10000! (do not know if 50000! also).
This is all in a Pentium 133Mmx (1 minute to compute+display)
with 48Mb RAM, so I think it should work in your computer.
The fact is that *this* (multiply bignum stack) did NOT work
in the previous versions, and I think (and thought) this is
what Dr. Schelter was intending to solve (?)
 
Hope this helps,

No problem.  Most advanced users of maxima will find
MathShield cumbersome and useless, so I don't blame
you for asking.  I'm targeting this for people like
myself and my fellow students, who basically just want
to compute a few integrals now and then and are not so
great at command line stuff. Also, it's a learning
experience for me in terms of coding, tools like cvs,
and how to think about designing and debugging, since
I've never really done any of that before beyond my
intro CS courses.

The way I hope to work this will be somewhat similar
to the way Mathematica has done it, i.e. formatting
things like fractions, square roots, exponents and
integral signs, while allowing people to enter text
commands when it suits their purpose (like
programming.)  From the mathml, perl scripts can then
be used to process the expression down into maxima
syntax, and then the same process in reverse can
translate certain parts of the answer into MathML
(leaving some as text) and send the to the display
widget.  For example, if I were entering an expression
with multiple fractions, exponentials within
exponentials, and other such fun complexities, I would
want to see it displayed in a formatted form in order
to better keep track of it.  However, for other things
like writing macsyma programs, you are correct in
saying that Mathml would be useless and a hinderance,
so in those instances the Mathml would give way to
pure text entry, which would still be allowed. 
Basically this is aimed at making a few of maxima's
abilities easier to use (at least for a user like me)
while hopefully not making more advanced usage
impossible.  

The reasons I picked MathML specifically are that
there has already been some work done on a GTK display
widget for MathML called GTKMathView and the hope that
MathML abilities in Mozilla would eventually open up
some possibilities for easy display of math notebooks
on the web.  

So that's the idea - to add formatting where it is
helpful and add some graphical tools for people who
(like me) are bad at remembering the syntax rules. 
Maybe a good analogy would be the Lyx program - most
advanced users use raw latex or tex because they have
more power and options, but a lot of people use Lyx
because it makes things simpler for them and their
needs are modest.  Lyx allows TeX expressions, but
also provides buttons for basic functionality.  I've
use Lyx quite a bit, and I've found I like that
approach.  You can start out doing things slowly with
the graphical buttons, but the equations are entered
as equations with immediate visual feedback rather
than long, cryptic text strings and as you gradually
learn the TeX commands you get faster.  To me, it
seems like a good way for beginners to approach maxima
too.  Whether I can pull it off or not is something
else again, but it never hurts to try and the worst
that will happen is that I'll know more rather than
less.  :-)

If you have a command structure in Mathshield that requires no
learning,  that would be interesting; is that the
point?  If it is just something else to learn, why would
fellow students like it any better? Do you have any
tests to show that it is easier to use?

I believe that Mathematica does not use MathML, though
it is willing to produce it if you wish. There is a
protocol used for communicating between front and
back ends of Mathematica  (mathtalk?) and there is
also a protocol with Maple (or used to be... Irena,
I think), and the commercial Macsyma uses some kind
of Lisp, plus some signalling mechanism.  You have
no signalling mechanism, and perhaps don't understand
why you need it.

If you are writing the front end, why not just have
the front end talk to the back end in something that
the back end already understands.  There are two
obvious choices:  the macsyma command language and the
underlying lisp.   You are just making more work
for yourself by having to write a translator into
mathml and a translator out.  You are also increasing
the bandwidth requirements by a factor of 50 or so as
well as lacking vital communication protocols, which
you presumably would just make up in some non-standard
way.
There are also programs to display math in typeset
form (in lisp, and also see MINSE/glyphd, which I am using,
which produces little GIFs for human consumption).

You seem to be concerned with perl and tk.  Do you
know lisp?  I think your project will require it,
and you might find that you will not need much else.

Maxima already does this.  Why not ask Maxima to 
send you the formatted expressions.

There is already math display (even conversion into
TeX) in maxima.  Are you going to go through every
construction in Maxima and convert it into MathML? Guess
what... not everything in Maxima has a MathML encoding.
And are you going to convert everything in MathML into
Maxima?  Guess what... some things may not be in Maxima.

Not a different command structure - I actually like
the maxima syntax.  All I mean is to have the
Mathematica ability of inputing things like integrals
"graphically" (for lack of a better term.) Sorry, I
guess I don't know how to express it more clearly.  Or
maybe I'm not thinking about maxima the correct way. 
Plus, while my fellow students using it would be nice,
considering most of them use windows anyway the odds
are actually rather low.  I just like the illusion of
doing something worthwhile. ;-)

I'm probably missing something there.  I was planning
on talking to maxima the way the Symaxx maxima
interface (http://symaxx.sourceforge.net) does - write
the proper instructions to a temp file and then invoke
the command line maxima using the file as the input.
They are using Perl/Tk, and I'm pretty sure that part
of it doesn't depend on Tk. Probably not the best way
to do it, but it's about the simplest and it's been
shown to work.  I confess to total ignorance here -
what function does the signaling mechanism serve?

That's essentially what I had intended to do - the
MathML would only be for the purpose of displaying the
formatted mathematics via the GTK widget.  Maxima
itself wouldn't ever get anything from the interface
but it's own syntax, and that's all it would need to
return - I shouldn't have to do anything to maxima
itself at all.

> for yourself by having to write a translator into
> mathml and a translator out.  

Very true, but I figured that would be less work than
writing my own GTK code from scratch to handle TeX
output.  Maybe it wouldn't be - that's a definite
possibility if I find that a MathML <-> maxima perl
script is too much work.  Remember, though - the only
real translation would be for a very small subset of
the MathML standard.  Fractions, exponentials,
integrals, stuff like that - the rest of the maxima
input/output would be in its original form throughout.

Do you mean communicating between the frontend and
maxima?  The only direct communication would be when
the frontend runs maxima on the temp file.  Symaxx
functions in this fashion, and I've never had a speed
problem with it.  I'm not sure what communication
protocols I would need - perl can just run the maxima
program with the temp file input - the frontend would
use the perl scripts to translate the maxima output
file into display ready content.  Unless I'm missing
something shouldn't be too much trouble for shorter
expressions (that is an unexplored point, I grant you
- I have to write the scripts before I can do speed
trials.  Still, since it is ascii text manipulation, I
can't imagine it being that slow.)

I don't know lisp (I would like to learn - that's
another one of those "if I only had time" or rather
"if only my school offered credit for it" things.)  If
that's how things shape up I'll give it a try.

It can send me back formatted expressions, yes - but I
want to be able to input with formatting as well.

I'm not hoping to do total conversions or anything
like that - only a few of the common things which can
get messy easily.  I may be crazy, but I'm not that
crazy :-) 
 
> I've never seen Lyx.

It's a nice piece of work (IMHO, of course) although
I'm sure it would frustrate any seasoned latex user. 
It's great for beginners.  (Or at least, it is for
this beginner.)

I think I blew my chances of impressing a potential
mate the first time I installed Linux. Power like that
is addictive. :-) All part of being a computer nerd -
or rather, part of becoming one.

Hello 

Looking at my students, it is clear that they don't like the command
line at all, so i find that an interface like mathematica for maxima is
a good project. 
It must allow to use classical mathematical notations for input and
output.

I have never seen this.   It would appear to be a problem with wish
(ie tcl/tk), on your machine or with your window manager.   Try
restarting the window manager -- at least this is what I do with fvwm
when for some reason I can't get netscape or other applications to take
the focus.   

You might also check the wish demos: run

/usr/lib/tk8.3/demos/widget

or whatever version tk you have.

Dear friends of maxima,

I can explain with better precision the 
feature I told you about a few days ago :

1. please launch fistly top to see the active processes

2. then launch xmaxima, then exit via the menu

3. if the behaviour is the same as on my Linux Mandrake 7.1 
   box, you'l quickly see saved-maxima using 98% of cpu time.

4. ad libitum, the cpu time being divided between the several
   saved-maxima processes...
   
I use maxima 5.6 compiled with gcl 2.4.0.

Using maxima 5.6. It is strange, but I use mandrake 7.2 at home and
everything works fine.  Here at work, I get exactly the same behaviour
as you describe.  I am using RH 6.2 here, with tk8.0.  At home I use
tk8.3.  However I did try the tk demos here at work and all the
menu/button demos worked just fine.
 I hope a solution is discovered.

Greetings!  Yes, apparently what's going on is that the xmaxima tcl is
closing the socket to the saved_maxima process without successfully
terminating it first.  saved_maxima then loops forever on select of
the file descriiptor, which being closed, returns a "bad file
descriptor" error.  Simplest fix would be to patch xmaxima, but maybe
it would be more robust if maxima itself exits when its input stream
is closed?

Take care,

Greetings, and thank you again for the wonderful work on
gcl-2.4.0/maxima-5.6!

It appears now with the compiled in inclusion of some of the gmp code
into gcl, that subarchitecture dependencies are introduced into the
resulting binaries.  This complicates making x86 binaries to include
in a distribution such as Debian.  Of course, the difference in
performance is well worth the extra effort.

Here's my plan -- build each of the gmp x86 subarch options as
separate shared libraries, install these under
/usr/lib/{k6,k7,p6,...}, and let ld.so load the fastest one at
runtime.  The portion of the gcl build which actually runs raw_gcl
will be invoked with an LD_LIBRARY_PATH choosing a generic shared
lib. 

Is this going to work?

Take care,

Subject: [Maxima] maxima 5.6 and cmucl
Message-ID: <4nlmo5hwz4.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

Grabbed the 5.6 release and rebuilt with cmucl.  Everything works but
I did run into a problem.

Some of the tests fail.  However, if I delete the mstuff fasl file and
recompile everything, the tests work just fine.  I have no idea why
this is.  My guess is something that's compiled before mstuff
influences how mstuff gets compiled, but only when that thing is
compiled, but it has no effect if that fasl is LOAD'ed before
compiling mstuff.

Also, I think I found the problem with cmucl and compiling plot.lisp.
The defstruct for polygon is wrapped inside an eval-when
compile/eval.  If I take that outside, and reinstate the make-polygon
macro (after renaming the defstruct constructor from make-polygon to
%make-polygon to prevent a collision), plots work.

Somehow either you have moved the gcl from where you built it or removed
cmpinclude.h from your directory /home/michel/download/gcl-2.4.0/o.

such thing, since the cmpinclude.h is in gcl-2.4.0/o  among other directories and that is in the gcc command line that is being passed.
Under the target all: in the main makefile, is the line.
	rm -f o/cmpinclude.h ; ln h/cmpinclude.h o
so there should be a copy there.

 in the configure of gcl, I included 
 (cd gmp ; ./configure --target=pentium) ;;

I intended to include a line in the gcl/configure.in to make the
configuration on any pentium, 686, pentiumpro, athlon etc use pentium
which I think should work for almost all machines now adays.  This
would hurt performance a bit, but at least let the same binary work on
all.  However, the '[' ']' got stripped in the making of configure
from configure.in and the test regexp i5-986* |pentium* | ...  which
would not match lots, and so the default configure is used for those
machines.  Ie a more machine specific one.  So you could just fix the
above in the configure.  I am still unsure what the best target to use
would be..  On the machine I was running on I found that the
distributed shared gmp.so was actually compiled incorrectly for my
architecture, and so gave a segfault on certain gcl operations.   That
is part of the reason I include the part of gmp we need, to make sure
it is compiled correctly.   Also I needed to include it to make some changes
to functions to help the gc.

Yes it would appear that gcl was not propagating correctly the failure

unixport/init_gcl.lsp:   On a more practical note, if you run out of space
like that you can remove the -pipe from the gcc flag, and it should

I tried rolling my own appendfile, but I wasn't able to make dribble append to a file, instead
dribble would overwrite the existing file.   I read maxima's info on append file, but I don't

   Mathematica ability of inputing things like integrals
   "graphically" (for lack of a better term.) Sorry, I
   guess I don't know how to express it more clearly.  Or
   maybe I'm not thinking about maxima the correct way. 

You really maybe should take a look/try at TeXmacs.
http://www.texmacs.org/ 

It lets you type in math in graphical form, but normally maxima input
is in maxima form, just the output is tex like form.   It actually
uses mactex.lisp (fateman's file).    The interface was done by
A.G.Grozin at inp.nsk.su    

It does not yet allow interrupts, but I think that is a solvable
problem, just as I do in netmath.  You just have to listen for a
signal or listen on a second channel.  Maxima can say accept a signal
and then do something, like stop the computation.  Under windows I
have a hack winkill.exe which lets me get around the lack of signals.

Also it needs something to associate to each part of the tex
expression the maxima part which generated it.   This should be
simple, yet would let mousing a subexpression.
This could be done on a second pass too:   For example if 
the maxima side remembered the lisp form of the tex expression it
sent, and then texmacs communicated back a certain string range
of the tex expression, then mactex.lisp could make a second pass
figuring out which subform caused the generation of the relevant
region of the string.
eg ((mplus) ((mexpt) $x ((mplus) $u $v))) ==> x^{u+v}
so if TexMacs said to maxima we have boxed something that is a
substring from 2 to 5, then it would be trivial for maxima to
know it was ((mplus) $u $v).

   are actually rather low.  I just like the illusion of
   doing something worthwhile. ;-) 

It is hard to know what is worth while till it is done.   Sometimes a
snazzy interface helps attract users, even if it is not as effective
as a simple one.

This is a fine solution as well.  I just uploaded last week a package
configured as a '486'.  Question: how much does maxima use the gmp
code?  How significant is the tuning of this library on the typical
overall performance of maxima?  Because it also appears as though the
shared lib approach will work.  This wastes disk space (~ 300k in the
included gmp sublib!) but provides a more optimal binary across
subarchitectures, provides a seamless cpu upgrade path, as well as
support for nfs mounting /usr across a LAN, etc.  I really don't know
how to evaluate the tradeoff.

That's alarming.  Hope it wasn't a Debian box :-)  If by chance it
was, please consider reporting it as a bug.

Yes this latter is especially important, AFAICT.  You state that you
replace a malloc with a tmp-alloc in one of the mpn files.  Does this
"help" gcl, or is it required to make it function correctly?  Have you
by any chance had the opportunity to request the gmp authors to
consider including this change?  Of course it would be cleaner if one
could avoid duplicating the gmp code/source, but a safe correct
functionality is of course the highest priority.

Can you foresee any problems compiling against an installed gmp
library version 2.0.2?

Thanks for this!  Actually, in general I have plenty of space -- I was

One final unrelated question -- do you know of any other applications
atop gcl?  Right now, the maxima build includes a gcl sub-build as
part of the process.  I'm considering reworking this to make a gcl-dev
package for Debian, and was wondering if there was any other code that
could benefit.




Take care,

   Yes this latter is especially important, AFAICT.  You state that you
   replace a malloc with a tmp-alloc in one of the mpn files.  Does this
   "help" gcl, or is it required to make it function correctly?  Have you
   by any chance had the opportunity to request the gmp authors to

I am afraid that change is necessary at least for the current
implementation in GCL.   Basically it is so we can use the strategy
for garbage collection.    I will try to convince the gmp
authors to make the change.    Also I would like to use a relocatable space
strategy for the bignums, but that will require some more minor changes
to gmp.   I think I have almost made them, but there is at least one
that is illuding me. [ (si::SET-GMP-ALLOCATE-RELOCATABLE t) will switch
to relocatable, but some random bugs will appear if you compute a lot!]

The changes I am making are ones that could be included in the
distribution.  But I think for the present we are safer in having a
copy of the gmp in gcl, especially since some users might not have gmp
on their system, and the number of functions we need from gmp is not
so huge.

I think for something like the debian distribution, your doing the 
486 distribution is a fine.    If someone is doing a lot of computations
involving bignums, he can recompile gcl/maxima himself for his machine.

A.G.Grozin at inp.nsk.su reports problem with redhat 7.0:

   1. Yesterday, I tried to install Maxima 5.6. It seems that there were no
   error messages during make (there were some warnings while making gcl
   2.4.0), but many self-tests fail. Also, I get the same behaviour as
   reported recently in sci.math.symbolic: integrate(x,x); yields
   x^2*false^2/2, integrate(sin(x),x); produces division by zero. This is on

I believe this is related to the buggy gcc version 2.96 released with
redhat/cygnus.  Basically it is badly broken on -O4 optimize and it is
hard to see how they could have released it.  I have made some patches
to gcl's configure and to the compiler invocation code, to not use
-O4 when this compiler version is there.   Please

I have patched the configure
in gcl to detect that buggy version.   Note that maxima is now compiled
on -O4 by default, and the above configure patch and patch to the 
compiler invocation in gcl, will shut off -O4 for this compiler.
Basically configure if it detects this compiler version should add
a #define BROKEN_O4_OPT, and the broken_o4_opt feature gets added
to the lisp, so that maxima will not get compiled with -O4.

So you should take the latest cvs/gcl or gcl daily snapshot to get
those changes if you are using redhat.  I dont have a redhat system
here myself, so if someone could please check this out.

Thanks

It would also be possible to have the input in graphical form.
Would this be useful for you? What syntax would be preferrable
in that case?

The best would be to have support for the standard unix signals.
TeXmacs uses SIGINT and SIGKILL.

Another current problem is how to handle multiple line input.
How can TeXmacs know whether maxima is waiting for more input
or whether maxima is computing some output?

I would rather be in favour of another mechanism
if this subexpression handling is really important,
although it may take a few months before I will implement it.

The idea would be that Maxima sends "labeled output" to TeXmacs:
each subexpression which you might want to select is given a label.
TeXmacs may send this label back when the expression is selected,
so that Maxima can reindentify the subexpression.

This mechanism has the great advantage of not complicating
the conversion algorithms (TeXmacs does NOT use LaTeX as its
intern format, so your LaTeX output is also being converted).
Furthermore, one might consider some more fancy add-ons,
like further expansion of the O() part of a power series if
you double click on it.

There are easy problems in typesetting, and hard ones.
The easy ones involve lines of conventional mathematics
that fit on one line.   
  a+b+c+d
The hard ones usually involve lines that must be
split over many lines, and in unusual ways.
  a+b+c+d+e+f
   +g+h+i+j+k
   +l+m
   - abcdefgh*
     ijklmn/
     (pqrst*
      uvwx)
Does Texmacs do this? If not, it does not solve
the hard problem in the "conventional" way.
There are other (not as good) ways of dealing with
large expressions like scrolling horizontally
or forceably ripping the horizontal expression
somehow  (this is inevitable in some sense, because
you can create single symbols that exceed a line
in length.  e.g. 1000!. 
)
There should be no problem in feeding labels to
Texmacs to identify what has been selected
functionally.   If you want to point to a
part of the expression in the Maxima system
as opposed to constructing a new subexpression,
you have to have pointers into the actual
lisp. This could be done (for example) by
hash-coding all subexpressions, giving them
tags, and telling Texmacs what those tags are.
However, not everything that you display
exists in the lisp. 
For example a/b is internally something like
(* a (expt b -1))  so there is no division.
a+b-c  is  (+ a b (* -1 c)) so there is
no "-", just a constant.
There is a program called FORMAT which is
used to make such changes prior to display.
If you pick things out of the result of
FORMAT, that is merely a temporary data object,
and not permanently stored.  There are
commands PART and INPART in Maxima.  INPART
works on the unformatted version, PART on
the formatted version.
  If you do not want pointers back into the
existing lisp, but are happy re-creating
subexpressions, then there are neater solutions.
I'm not sure what is required though.

   The idea would be that Maxima sends "labeled output" to TeXmacs:
   each subexpression which you might want to select is given a label.
   TeXmacs may send this label back when the expression is selected,

The problem I see with labeling input is one has no idea what the user
might select.  He selects a form on the texmacs side with the mouse.
It might be terms 20-24 of a polynomial 100 terms long.  Or that might
be in the numerator or exponent or matrix entry.  As you parse it into
the internal TexMacs tree formula, you could just record as you start
a tree what character index you were at in the input string -- or else
perhaps better have a subsequent parse pass compute the range in case
the user moused some box ...  In this latter method there is no extra
storage associated either on the maxima or texmacs side, just a cost
of running thru the display code a second time.

I once constructed something like texmacs where I did the display myself,
and this is what I did.

Once again, the problem is that there is not just one parsing algorithm
involved : you have at least three parsing algorithms followed by several
tree rewriting passes in order to upgrade to the current TeXmacs version.
It would be very difficult in this stage to associate string locations to
each cursor position.

On the other hand, what you say is not necessarily a problem and
we may inspire ourselves by the way XML handles portions of a document.
In order to specify an entry of a matrix, we might use
something like [Label matrix]/[x,y-position], for a range of terms
[Label polynomial]/[start position]-[end position].

Indeed, this is true. I tried to compile gcl-2.4.0 & maxima-5.6 on
my AltLinux Spring 2001(this is the Russian edition of Mandrake 7.2).
This distribution has gcc-2.96. So, I had problem with rtest(3,5,6,13,14).mac's.
Then, I replaced the link gcc to gcc-2.95.3 and  recompiled gcl and maxima.
There were no problems with tests and with things like integrate(x,x) as well, after this.

My overview of an implementation is this:

Maxima computes a result.  a/b.  Internally this is

((mtimes simp) $a ((mexpt simp) $b -1)).  Let's abbreviate this
to  
 (* a (^ b -1))

The formatting program changes this to 
 (quotient a b) and the display program  (DISPLA) prints it
as
 A
---
 B

I do not know much about Texmacs, but perhaps one could work at
this...
after running through format, and then through mactex, we get
something like
 {a \over b}    or maybe \frac...  [I don't really care]

The new version would be 
(\tag 1 {\tag 2 {\frac  {\tag 3 a} {\tag 4 b}}}}

where internal to maxima we have a hash table that has, for every
expression sent to the front end, an index into the formatted (not
the internal) form.  That is, hashing
(1 2 3) or maybe just 3
  would be a pointer to the location of the "a" in expression
1.
(1 2) or just 2 would be the whole fraction.

calling the simplifier on the formatted form produces a simplified
internal form.  It is not the same tree as we started with, but should
be pretty close.

Anyway, selecting terms 20 to 24 of a 100 term polynomials would
(I guess) require communicating 2 or more index sets to the back end,
where the pieces would be assembled.  

On the Texmacs side, you would have to strip off the tags and save
the index numbers, and support pointing/selection.  This is now
supported by commercial macsyma and mathematica, as well as the
very nice interactive systems http://www.livemath.com/
by Allan Bonadio.
 ( In fact, a nice solution to the user interface
but not free) would be to take Bonadio's
system and attach Maxima to it. You should in any case
take a long look at Bonadio's design!)

I can do this. But we might do more later, by communicating something like
an XML-like-subdocument, whatever the use of such a facility might be...

On the TeXmacs side, I would have a typesetting construct "tag",
which takes two arguments : an invisible label, and the tagged expression.
Whenever you select an expression, I might return all corresponding tag
information. For other purposes, the tags might be stripped.

No problem, this can be implemented in a few hours inside TeXmacs.

I'll take a look when I have time. Anyway, I do have lots of ideas waiting
to be implemented, so time is more a problem as ideas...
What is interesting about TeXmacs, is that many computer algebra systems
have already been linked (up to 8 at this moment), so the comments by
different people might lead to a free greatest-common-useful interface.
Don't forget that TeXmacs il *also* an extensible typesetting system :
you may directly incorporate your computations in TeXmacs articles.
Finally, TeXmacs will become a WEB-authoring tool, as soon as the
converters with Html/Mathml/Xml are ready...

I need to solve a linear programming problem
with symbolic coefficients. I found the
"kach" program in the maxima distribution,
but there is no demo file.

Is there a demo file for it, or are there any
other linear programm solvers out there?

The Kachian algorithm was programming by Paul Wang
who is now at Kent State University.  I hope your
problem is very small.

Kachian's algorithm is an algorithm that produces a numerical approximation
to an optimal solution to an LP.  The LP would have to be expressed with
numerical coefficients.  
 
I'm not aware of any general purpose algorithm for solving an LP with
symbolic coefficients.  However, if the coefficients are rational numbers,
then it is possible to get an exact rational answer using the simplex
algorithm.  This is implemented for example in Maple V.  

There are also "sensitivity analysis" techniques for analyzing the optimal
solution to an LP to determine for what range of coefficients the solution
would remain optimal.  It's possible that such techniques would be useful
here.

Anyone know if anyone has gotten Maxima to run on an OpenVMS Alpha platform?

I know that there used to be a OpenVMS VAX version of Macsyma so I'm 
wondering if anyone has worked with Maxima.

(I loved Macsyma, used to bring many a university VAX to a crawl with large 
plots.  So I was happy to see Maxima :})

If not, I think I could probably give a shot at porting it, that is, if I 
can find a Lisp system for OpenVMS :}

Thanks for the great work on Maxima, I love it.

Greetings!  I know of no such port, but would encourage your efforts
here.  Unless you intend to use an existing lisp on this platform, the
real job will be in porting gcl, after which compiling maxima should
be straightforward.  In principle, one need only supply a <arch>.defs
and <arch>.h file in gcl-2.4.0/h/, and make sure that configure
selects this arch.  In practice, I've found getting a correct set of
definitions in these files a bit challenging, and really requiring more
time than I have.  If you do succeed, please post your changes here --
I'd wager they'd be close to the modifications necessary to get a
compile on a Debian Linux Alpha.

Take care,

   Is it possible to mix Lisp and Maxima code in the same file and
   have Maxima load, translate, and compile the file?  I haven't been
   able to do this

Here are simple examples with one lisp form and one maxima form, but
there can of course be many such forms in the file:

The following is lisp file can be loaded with load("foo.lisp");
=======foo.lisp=================
(in-package "MAXIMA")
(defun $joe (x) (+ x 1))
#$f(n):=block([ans:0],
     for j:1 thru n do ans:ans+x^j,
      ans)$
==============end foo.lisp=======
and you will be able to do
(C1) load("foo.lisp")$ 
(C2) joe(5);
(D2) 6
(C3) f(3);
(D3) x^3+x^2+x

The above file however will not compile, and the maxima function
f still acts as a regular maxima function.    In order to translate
it to lisp so that the compiler can act on it do the following:


(C1) load("help.lisp");  /* see this file below */
(C2) :lisp (compile-file "foo.lisp")
(C2) load("foo.o");

=======foo1.lisp=================
(in-package "MAXIMA")
(defun $joe (x) (+ x 1))
(tr #$$f(n):=block([ans:0],
     for j:1 thru n do ans:ans+x^j,
      ans)$ )
========end foo1.lisp============

The helper macro 'tr' is defined in help.lisp (note
we also have to define send, since it is used by the double $$
sharp reader macro we use in the above.    We will add that
function to maxima in the next release.

=========help.lisp========================================
(in-package "MAXIMA")
;; some patches to let the above mixed lisp and maxima work ok.
(defun send (a b) (if (eql b :tyi) (tyi a) (error "unknown send")))
(defmacro tr (u)
 (and (consp u) (eq (car u) 'quote)
  (BIND-TRANSL-STATE (translate-macexpr-toplevel  (second u)))))
===========================================================

Please note that the translation from maxima to lisp is not guaranteed
to keep all the 'features' of the maxima language.   If you are having
a problem with speed of your maxima level code, certainly you can
try translating and compiling it.   You can also write critical portions
of your code directly in lisp which will almost certainly produce faster
code.

I am putting a fix in the cvs directory

http://cvs.math.utexas.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi?cvsroot=maxima

See bin/xmaxima

If you get a new xmaxima then it should work correctly if either the
window manager shuts it down with a 'delete' or if you use either of
the 'exit' menus on xmaxima.    Note I believe the MS windows version was
correct, and this got broken in making the windows version ...

ps:  However if you just destroy the xmaxima or kill it with a
signal, then the maxima process is still left running and needs to be killed
with a signal.    I should fix that too .. but later.

I need to use extended euclidean algorithm to solve some diophantine
equations. I'd like to use free software for this, but unfortunately I
can't find a corresponding routine in either Maxima or Pari/GP.

In maple there is the function gcdex, when given polynomials a(x) and
b(x), it finds c and d such that
	c*a(x) + d*b(x) = 1
For example, if a(x)=x^16+1 and b(x)=x^16-1, then c=1/2 and d=-1/2 because

			      16        16
			     x   + 1   x   - 1
 			     ------- - ------- = 1
				2	  2

Have I missed something, or can't Maxima (nor Pari!) really do this?

Another thing that bugs my slightly is that Maxima uses only 80 columns to
display even if I'd have much more.

Oddly enough, the user level of Maxima seems not to
have an implementation of the extended Euclidean algorithm.

(Macsyma has one: extgcd).

It takes about 6 lines of code to write it.
What makes it odd is that Maxima uses this code internally
in many places.  It has to be set up right, with a main variable,
which may make it tricky to do in some robust user-friendly way.

To change the line length to, say, 100,  type  linel:100$

In the "preferences" menu there is a mention of

"fixed font"


If you type, for example, describe("gcd")  there are several items
listed and you are invited to type one or more of their
numbers.
  It seems you must terminate the line with a ";" or
nothing happens. But the ";" is left over and becomes
a null command line after the describe() is finished.

Hi,

 I'm working on some routines for optimization using Maxima (e.g,
second-order Newton method, Levenberg-Marquardt), and I've run into a
problem with routines related to matrix manipulation.  For example, when one
solves a matrix equation A.x = b by using x:invert(A).b, x is a list of
lists.  So, when this is done in an iterative loop, the problem compounds
itself so that on the next iteration one gets a list of list of lists, etc.
Another example is when one forms a row vector by doing something like
v:transpose([1,2,3]) - this also gives a list of lists.  Is there any way of
controlling or avoiding this behavior in Maxima?  I am not yet sufficiently
familiar with Maxima programming to see a way out of this.

 Many thanks for any advice, etc., on this.

 Sincerely,

 David Holmgren

I don't know what exactly you are doing to make
an extra level of lists, but if you want to extract
the nth row of a matrix, try part(mat,n).  I suppose
a column could be obtained by transposing first.

Is it perhaps the case that a column vector in
macsyma is not what you think , but a 2-d matrix
one of whose dimensions is 1?

Hi,

	As an example, take a:transpose([1,2,3]) which is a column vector.
When you say a[1], Maxima returns [1] and not 1, which is more desirable in
some situations (eg., when you compute x+dx, where x and dx are two
vectors).  Effectively, a seems to be [[1],[2],[3]] rather than the [1,2,3]
I expected (with everything transposed to make column vectors of course).  I
can certainly apply part(a,1) repeatedly, but it would be nice to not have
to do this.

	I certainly appreciate that, but again, if a vector is updated in a
loop, you can end up with several dimensions.  Generally, I've found that
Maxima crashes before proceeding too far along these lines!

There are a bunch of flags, but none that looks
like it will do exactly what you want
try describe("listarith")   
and describe("scalarmatrixp");

macsyma does allow ordinary lists [a,b,c]
to participate as vectors in matrix operations.

Question About Matrices: 

1)  A matrix is ALWAYS represented internally as a list of rows, each row
of which is a maxima list.

If M is a matrix then M[i] is the ith row, and hence a list.  Similarly
M[i,j] is an entry the i,j entry with 1,1 top left corner entry. 

2)  If you do transpose(x) and x is a matrix or list the result is always a matrix.
The case of x a list is a convenient way of building a column matrix

3)  To turn a matrix into a simple list of all the entries, with first row then
second row etc.. you could do:

ListMatrixEntries(m):=block([ans:[]],
       for v in m do ans:append(ans,v),
       ans);

ListMatrixEntries(matrix([a,b],[c,d]))==>[a,b,c,d]
ListMatrixEntries(transpose([a,b,c])) ==> [a,b,c]

In lisp to define the same thing you could do
(defun $LIST_MATRIX_ENTRIES (m)
   (or ($matrixp m) (error "not a matrix"))
   (cons '(mlist) (sloop for v in (cdr m) append (cdr v))))


I will add this function to maxima
since I know from experience it is useful.   I call it
$LIST_MATRIX_ENTRIES to be compatible with the usual conventions in maxima.

Note
(defun |$ListMatrixEntries| (m) ...) would have defined the one with the mixed
case name.

   In maple there is the function gcdex, when given polynomials a(x) and
   b(x), it finds c and d such that
	   c*a(x) + d*b(x) = 1

I have added a little file gcdex.mc in the share/gcdex.mc
distribution which does what you want [it is below], ie the euclidean
algorithm for univariate polynomials which can then demonstrate that
this is a principal ideal domain, by finding gcd of f and g in the
ideal generated by f and g.

line width:

  As richard said, the maxima variable linel, or the lisp variable linel
control the line width of the terminal display.   linel:80 being the default.
If you can determine your linewidth automatically somehow then you could
use the lisp (setq linel (si::getenv "COLUMNS") ) or some such thing in the
init.lsp loaded from your directory where you start maxima.  xmaxima is supposed
to figure out the linewidth, since it is actually handling the window.


=============begin gcdex.mc========== 
/* gcdex(f,g) yields a list [a,b,u] where
  u is the GCD of f and g, and 
  u = f*a+g*b;

    F and G should be univariate polynomials so that we are in a principal
    ideal domain, and the ideal generated by (f,g) is indeed generated
    by the gcd of f and g.

  mytest(f,g):=block([ans:gcdex(f,g)],
		 [ratsimp(ans.[f,g,-1]),
		  remainder(f,ans[3]),
		  remainder(g,ans[3])]);

gcdex(f,g):=block([q0,q1,ok:true,lis1,lis2,lis3,q,tem,var:listofvars([f,g]),

Thank you! It does exactly what I want. I did found the corresponding
function in Pari ("bezout") but it's nicer to have everything in one
program, ie. Maxima.

Env. variable COLUMNS is probably rarely used, I think there's an ioctl to
do that. It should be easy to add a new Lisp function (written in C) to
return the current line width. Would you like a patch if I make one (when
I have some time)? How it should be called, "si::get-line-length"?

One should also listen for SIGWINCH signals to know when the terminal is
resized, but that's over my skills.

I suggest: 

   ListMatrixEntries (M):=  apply (append, substinpart("[",M,0))$

in lisp,
  (defun $LIST_MATRIX_ENTRIES (m)... (apply #'append (cdr v))  instead
of sloop...

In the diophantine equation gcdex example, I think there
are a couple of ways of improving it.

Thesize of the program can be reduced by using multiple assignment
syntax (a secret? in macsyma).
 [a,b,c]:[1,2,3]  assigns a:1, b:2, c:3.

 [quo,rem]: divide(p,q,x)  sets the quotient and remainder [main var x]

 I usually set the original inputs into rat form, making
it unnecessary to call ratsimp along the way.  It should
be possible to copy the gcdex out of Knuth vol 1, but
I'm away from my library right now.

It should be possible to do the computation even if the
two inputs are not univariate, by choosing to do the
computations in the quotient field of the other variables.
thus the call could be gcdex(u,v,x), where x is also used
in the call to divide.

The various options here are probably what made people
nervous about including the program as a user command.

The commercial Macsyma (or formerly commercial?)
has this program:

XTGCD(poly_or_integer, poly_or_integer)

[ALGFUNCS package] Computes the extended Euclidean algorithm for the
integers and/or univariate polynomials with integer coefficients.
Returns the list [p(x), a(x), b(x)] where q(x) and r(x) are the
arguments to EXTGCD, p(x) is their g.c.d., and a(x) and b(x) satisfy
Bezout's identity

 p(x) = a(x)*q(x) + b(x)*r(x) .

Do EXAMPLE(EXTGCD); for an executable example. 

See also EXTGCD_INTEGER.

The EXTGCD code follows the design in 

 J.H. Davenport, Y. Siret, and E. Tournier
 Computer Algebra: Systems and algorithms for algebraic computation
 Academic Press (1988), pp. 213-214 

even down to the names used.

You might prefer this version of gcdex, though it takes
an additional argument, the main variable..., it does
not require that expressions be univariate.

gcdex1(m,n,x):=
/* Given 2 expressions m and n in x, we compute their
GCD and two multipliers a and b such that a*m+b*n=d.
Knuth vol 1 algorithm E */
block([ap,b,bp,r:1,q],
 [ap,b,a,bp,m,n]:[1,1,0,0,rat(m,x),rat(n,x)],
 loop, [q,r]:divide(m,n,x),
  if(r=0) then   [a,b,n]/content(n,x)[1]
   else
  ([m,n,t]:[n,r,ap],
  [ap,a,t,bp]: [a,t-q*a,bp,b],
  b:t-q*b,
  go (loop)))$

Here's a checking program.. which should return 0.

checkg(m,n,x):= ([a,b,d]: gcdex1(m,n,x), a*m+b*n=d)

checkg (a*z+1,b*z-1,z);



the results, but not checkg,  are different if you
choose as main variable a or b...



PS, apologizes for the goto.. Knuth uses it..

Package: maxima
Version: 5.6-6
Severity: normal

The result of the "sum" command displays the summation symbol
with the symbols in the wrong places:

Actual maxima output:

(C2) sum(n^2,n,1,n);

                                 n
                                   ====
                                   \2
(D2)                                >n
                                   /
                                   ====
                             n = 1


Output should be:

(C2) sum(n^2,n,1,n);

                                      n
                                   ====
                                   \     2
(D2)                                >   n
                                   /
                                   ====
                                  n = 1


I have a windows version of maxima 5.5 that displays correctly so the
difference may have occurred between maxima 5.5 and maxima 5.6.

I list four responses grouped together, so that I dont flood you
with too much mail...   But given the length of this message maybe you
prefer separate ones!!

I.  Camm:

   Error maxima output of not centered...

I have added a correction in cvs to displa.lisp.   This bug was introduced when I
added the stuff for allowing sums over lists, and the integration of f/g
with g irreducible, by making it a sum over the roots of...

   of sloop...

I put the version using 'sloop' in the sources because I think it is
more readable, and I KNOW it is efficient in every lisp, not creating
any more cons's than absolutely necessary.   For example if you do
5000 iterations of doing list_matrix_entries of a 7 7 matrix.


  Cons's    Seconds     Method
  250,000    1.27       sloop method

3,600,000   42.0        apply (append, substinpart("[",M,0))$  

I guess I am very sensitive to storage use and timings .. and I probably 
go a little overboard on making things efficient.    But I do think the sloop

   (sloop for row in (cdr matrix) append (cdr row))
  "for each row  in matrix append the row"
is pretty readable.   Of course I wrote the sloop macro, so thats probably
why I think it is readable, but it is also why I am sure it is efficient.

The lisp version you suggest:
  (defun $LIST_MATRIX_ENTRIES1 (m)
    (or ($matrixp m) (error "not a matrix"))
    (apply #'append (cdr m)))

needs to use '$append since the rows are maxima lists not lisp lists.
Note the timings were done on a slow notebook (166Mhz) here in St Petersburg
russia, and so may appear high.    Functions were compiled, and I used gcl's
gc monitor.  

==========================
III.

   You might prefer this version of gcdex, though it takes
   an additional argument, the main variable..., it does
   not require that expressions be univariate.

   gcdex1(m,n,x):=

Thank you yes we should handle the case where coefficients are in some rational
function field.  
Normally when we speak about gcd of elements in k[x,y] we mean in the 
polynomial ring in two variables, where of course ideals cannot be
generated by one element .. their gcd.

x k[x,y] + y k[x,y]  != 1 k[x,y]

But if we look at the field of fractions k(y) and then adjoin x, then
of course that ring k(y)[x] is a Principal ideal domain (indeed a euclidean
domain), and we can use the euclidean algorithm and produce elements which
will be fractions in y but polynomials in x.    I have modified share/gcdex.mc
to allow an optional argument specifying a main variable.   Just remember the
gcd is not the usual multivariate gcd!

gcdex(x*(y+1),y^2-1,x);

				      1
(D1)    		        [0, ------, 1]
				     2
				    y  - 1

saying the 'gcd' is 1, since that is what it is in k(y)[x],
however it would be of course y+1 if we were just thinking in k[x,y].

Note that I did not actually get the code you sent to work correctly.
I added SUBSCRMAP:true to the binds, so that the list assignments would be ok,
but still it gave incorrect answers:
(C17) gcdex1(x^3+2,x^3+1,x);

			     3	     3	     3
(D17)/R/ 		   [x  + 1, x  + 1, x  + 1]

but anyway I am sure knuth's algorithm is correct and there is just a typo somewhere..
but I dont have the book with me and so can't verify it, and once I have one
working it is hard to go back and trouble shoot another!

Good *ing,

     This is a suggestion for William (and/or anyone interested in
developing it... maybe I should try to do it myself, but ;-)
better if someone with more experience tries to).

       I think Maxima should have an easy method for plotting para-
metric curves and surfaces..., like

       parametricplot2d([3*cosh(t),3*sinh(t)],[t,-2,2]);

to plot a ---guess it--- hyperbola, and

       parametricplot3d([cos(theta)*cosh(t),
       sin(theta)*sinh(t),t],[t,-3,3],
       [theta,-%PI,%PI]);

for a catenoid (?).

I know it could be done using the gnuplot interface, etc... but I 
think a straightforward command for omplot (great!) would be best.

Thanks in advance, 

	  Pedro.

I have added a 2d parametric plot.   I believe I added the 3d one a couple
of years ago, and I am not sure why I did not do a 2d one..

For plot3d for example doing a moebius band:
          plot3d([cos(x)*(3+y*cos(x/2)),
                    sin(x)*(3+y*cos(x/2)),y*sin(x/2)],
                     [x,-%pi,%pi],[y,-1,1],['grid,50,15]);

thus the first argument is a list of 3 functions, in the parametric case.

For plot2d, since the argument could already be a list of functions (meaning
plot them all simultaneously on the same window), I added parametric expressions:
things like

    [parametric,cos(t),sin(t),[t,-5,5]]

which would mean the unit circle.   

          (C1) plot2d([parametric,cos(t),sin(t),[t,-%pi*2,%pi*2]]);
          (C2) plot2d([parametric,cos(t),sin(t),[t,-%pi*2,%pi*2],
                  [nticks,8]]);
          (C3) plot2d([x^3+2,[parametric,cos(t),sin(t),[t,-5,5]]],
                  [x,-3,3]);


 - Function: PLOT2D (expr,range,...,options,..)
 - Function: PLOT2D ([expr1,expr2,..,exprn],xrange,...,options,..)
 - Function: PLOT2D (parametric_expr)
 - Function: PLOT2D ([..,expr,..,parametric_expr,..],xrange,...,options)

are the possibilities, so you can plot several parametric expressions.

william

[these things are in the cvs, you need
src/plot.lisp  src/max_ext.lisp info/Plotting.texi
and I also had to change the gcl function info mechanism slightly (1 character
change) to handle the 'describe' of multiple line info entries like the above.. see

does not give any result with the option ['plot_format, GNUPLOT] and the
data file "maxout.gnuplot" can be plotted via gnuplot after some changes.
It will probably need some changes in "mgnuplot" file, I guess. Does
anybody have an idea, how to change this file, please? 

Thanks for any hints
Yours faithfully

Subject: [Maxima] how to increase the maximum number of pages in gcl?
Message-ID: <3B2B6FC9.4010903@purdue.edu>

Hi,

I'm running a big messy job, and run out of memory quickly.  (Allocate 
'cons really-big-number) doesn't help, because there just aren't enough 
pages to go 'round.  I've tried setting *ignore-maximum-pages* to true, 
but that doen't seem to produce any effect.  (Room) produces the 
following output at the beginning of a job:

That 32768 maximum pages seems to work out to about 128M, and  I may 
well need four times that.  I'm running this on a machine with 512M of 
ram and tons of swap space, and buying more ram isn't out of the 
question, so it makes sense to have a really big maximum pages. 

Is there an argument on the command line when I run gcl, or is there 
something I can edit in the config or makefile, which will give me some 
extra room?

Thanks,
Nels Tomlinson

To enable a larger page table in gcl you must configure it at compile time:
cd gcl
./configure '--enable-maxpage=128*1024'
make

and then remove maxima/src/saved_maxima and remake in the maxima directory.

The default should probably be bigger now that memory is so cheap.

Note from the ./configure --help:
 --enable-maxpage=XXXX will compile in a page table of size XXX (eg '--enable-maxpage=64*1024' would give 64K pages allowing 256 MB if pages are 4K each)

4.  The Maxima version of apropos is documented, but seems to be missing.  This
works for me:

(defun $apropos ( s )
   (cons '(mlist) (apropos-list s "MAXIMA")
)


5.  The Macsyma Inc function facsum was handy for putting expressions in to a readable
form; unfortunately, facsum is missing from Maxima.  At first I thought I could use
factorout instead.  The following does what I wanted:

(C8) factorout(a*z + b*z + 1,a,b);
(D8) (b+a)*z+1

But  the following doesn't:

(C13) factorout(s * 'diff(z,s) + z * 'diff(z,s) + 1,z,s);
(D13) z*'DIFF(z,s,1)+s*'DIFF(z,s,1)+1

With the facsum function, we would get

(c1) facsum(s * 'diff(z,s) + z * 'diff(z,s) + 1, 'diff(z,s));

(d1)    (s + z) * 'diff(z,s) + 1

If anybody has a facsum function they can legally share, let me know.  (The Macsyma
documentation says it was written by RL Brenner and is in the facexp package.)

6.  Is the Maxima Poisson package broken?

(C1) intopois(cos(x) + 1);
Illegal arg to POISSIMP:
x
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)


7.  The Maxima FFT package is missing files or is broken.  Anybody have one?

try  intopois (cos(X)^2+1)   ;;  NOTE CAPITAL X.  the vars you can use are
U V W X Y Z   not x.

This package was rewritten (by me) to be more flexible. It was given
to Macsyma Inc.  I wonder if I own the rights?  (I got a carton of
manuals in return for this.)

simp.lisp incorrectly sets machine-mantissa-precision to be 24:

(eval-when (compile load)

For double precision, machine-mantissa-precision  should be 53;
changing it corrects the problem with the precision of the rational

machine-mantissa-precision with

Please forgive the newbie question.  As I'm reading
about GCL, is it correct that the maxima code is first
translated to C code, and then compiled by gcc?  Sorry
if this should be obvious but I'm not completely clear
on exactly how the compile process works.

Subject: [Maxima] Changevar bug
Message-ID: <3B365523.4B5AA4FD@cybernex.net>

This looks like a bug in something that changevar calls. Consider
the following:

(C2) expr1:sqrt(a^2+sqrt(b^2+c/x));
				      c	   2	 2
(D2) 			    SQRT(SQRT(- + b ) + a )
				      x
(C3) assume(a>0,b>0,c>0,x>0,y>0,y>a);
(D3) 		  [a > 0, b > 0, c > 0, x > 0, y > 0, y > a]
(C4) int1:'integrate(expr1,x);
			 /
			 [	     c	  2     2
(D4) 			 I SQRT(SQRT(- + b ) + a ) dx
			 ]	     x
			 /
(C5) change1:y=expr1;
					c    2	   2
(D5) 			  y = SQRT(SQRT(- + b ) + a )
					x
(C6) changevar(int1,change1,y,x);
			 /
			 [	     c	  2     2
(D6) 			 I SQRT(SQRT(- + b ) + a ) dx
			 ]	     x
			 /

Maxima can't do that but it can do:

(C7) int2:scanmap(factor,changevar(int1,change1^2,y,x));
     2	  2
Is  a  - y   positive, negative, or zero?


negative;

		       /			   2    2
		       [ y (y - a) (y + a) SQRT(2 a  - y )
(D7) 		 - 4 c I --------------------------------- dy
		       ]     2	      2 2   2	     2 2
		       /   (y  - b - a )  (y  + b - a )


The sqrt term is incorrect. It should be y. Maxima should have known
that y^2 > a^2 from the assumptions but it definitely knows because
I told it so.  It ignored all that, assumed a^2 > y^2, and got the 
wrong answer.

Perhaps the problem is related to this:

(C8) change2:solve(change1^2,x)[1];
     2	  2
Is  a  - y   positive, negative, or zero?


negative;
					c
(D8) 			  x = ----------------------
			       4      2	 2    2	   4
			      y  - 2 a  y  - b  + a

(C9) frob:subst(change2,expr1);

                                 4      2  2    4     2
(D9)                  SQRT(SQRT(y  - 2 a  y  + a ) + a )  

Obviously, the inner sqrt is the issue. Note also,

(C10) scanmap(factor,frob);
						  2
(D10) 			  SQRT((y - a) (y + a) + a )

(C11) scanmap(factor,frob,bottomup);

This last bit is just bad.

The maxima code is lisp, mostly.  Some pieces are
in the "macsyma language" and some may be in C or even
assembler. 

There are many implementations
of lisp.  Some of them just execute the lisp in
an interpretive fashion. Some compile lisp into assembler
or binary code.  Some of them translate lisp into C 
and then compile it.

Maxima has been compiled on several lisps with different
strategies.  For example the Allegro Common Lisp version
compiles from lisp into assembler. GCL uses C.  There
is nothing inherent in Maxima that requires it to ever
be translated to C. It is just GCL's implementation
strategy.  The nice thing about it is that there are
so many systems with C compilers, that it is a fairly
general approach to portability.


If you want to learn how to compile lisp, there are various
places to look.  A good one is Peter Norvig's  Paradigms
of AI programming. (It includes considerable amounts of
other material also).

Hi;

I realize this is an unreasonable question. But what are mailing lists
for? :-)

I want to put together a FreeBSD port for maxima (analogous to an srpm
for Linux folks.)  Unfortunately release 5.6 does not work for me,
while the CVS current does.  Basically I need a known good snapshot or
release to work against.  Are there plans for such a snapshot/release
in the near future?

Of course I can always tar up the tree I just checked out (or use cvs
export), but I'd rather not distribute a "rogue" version.

All the best,

David

Message-ID: <593F7F3472A5D211B99B0008C7EAA08A06C891A0@eseis02nok>

Hello,

I think the function 'FORMAT' does what you tried with FACSUM.

I tried FORMAT(s * 'diff(z,s) + z * 'diff(z,s) + 1, %poly('diff(z,s)))
and got (z+s)*'diff(z,s,1)+1.
The function comes in a package, which can be downloaded here:
http://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/computer-algebra/
(Installation does not work the way it should on my machine, I had to
'compile_file' the format.lisp and coeflist.lisp files by hand and
'loadfile' the resulting .o files before using FORMAT.
The package also provides its own Poisson function, as far as I know.

Subject: [Maxima] Maxima for Darwin?
Message-ID: <200106291638.NAA05315@xena.urbi.com.br>

Hi,

I wish we could have a port of Maxima for Darwin, Apple's new OS.

First I attempted to build GCL, but I couldn't so far and nobody was capable
yet.

To start with, I'd be glad with a command-line tool. So, I'm wondering how
to do that.

i)Is it possible to use another compiler?
ii)Is there a workaround? Like transform lisp files in C files --- that's
what gcl does isn't it?

If you have any idea, I'd really appreciate any kind of help or hint.

Thanks a lot,
Lizardo.

Subject: [Maxima] how to replace factors
Message-ID: <20010630064910.7013.qmail@community7.interfree.it>

I am trying to exploit maxima to check some algebric calculations of mine;
replacement of factors with others is something i am not able to get:
Here is an example, in which chi*om12 should be changed into omega12, when
the expressions are elements of a matrix, as in the batch file here enclosed.
You can see that replacemnt in gradFF matrix elements has not had effect,
i.e.:
  (C49) gradFF[1,1];

  (D49) 2 v (t3 v + t2 v + j2 v - chi om12 t1)

   + 4 v (t3 v - t1 v - J1 v + chi om23 t2)

   + 2 v (t2 v - t1 v - (j2 + J1) v + chi om13 t3)

By the way, gradFF is a vector, but it seemed that using a second (fixed)
index to print out its elements gave no trouble, rather it allowed to hide
the square brackets on the borders.

I have checked that replacement can be performed in simpler expressions, 
so it is possible that my troubles are due to the way my matrix has been
built up. 

thank you for your help

First, try using ratsubst instead of subst:

(C5) subst(omega23, chi * om23, chi^2 * om23^2 + 43);
(D5) chi^2*om23^2+43
(C6) ratsubst(omega23, chi * om23, chi^2 * om23^2 + 43);
(D6) omega23^2+43

If this doesn't work, you can instead try something like

subst(omega23 / chi, om23, ...)

P.S.  Many thanks for the folks who helped me with Poisson and helped me
find the format package the other week; format has worked well for me and it even
contains an enhanced Poisson package.  Finally,
 (setq machine-mantissa-precision (float-digits 1.0d0)) works for me.

The mmod function in trigi.lisp is to blame for the problem with sin(n %pi
/ 2) with
n declared an integer.  Changing MMOD to

(defun MMOD (x y)
  (cond ((and ($ratnump x) ($ratnump y))
      (let
          ((d (lcm ($denom x) ($denom y))))
        (setq x (mul* d x))
        (setq y (mul* d y))
        (div (mod x y) d)))
     (t nil)))

seems to fix this problem. After make, Maxima was then able to correctly evaluate
sin(n %pi), sin(n %pi / 2),  cos(n %pi), and cos(n %pi / 2), where n is declared to
be an integer.

Message-ID: <20010702160037.A4393@wigner.cstc.lan>

Thank you for your help on substitutiion procedures, i managed to
rearrange my expressions properly

A questions about factoring out expressions in arrays: my aim is to factor out
each element in dotdensity array, defined below.
 
Each element in array dotdensity contains elements from array c. 
I should be able to factor out each element in dotdensity with respect to every 
elemnt in c, exept for the null ones.
As an example take the element (1,1):
 
 (C11) dotdensity[1,1];

 (D11)                      %I c  cc  V - %I cc  c  V
                                1   2          1  2

That should be factored into:   %I V ( c  cc   -  cc  c  )
                                        1   2       1  2

Since i do not which c   parameters appear in dotdensity[i,j], i tried to factor out 
                      k
with respect to every c , using the listarray function, but no luck.
                       k 
Listarray(c) yields
  (C7) listarray(c);

Hi,

I'm trying to port Maxima for Darwin. First I need a Common LISP compiler.
But I couldn't install GCL from sources...

I wish I could have a minimal port with Maxima as a comand-line tool at
least. So, I'm asking you:

i) Is there a document describing what are the portions of Maxima and how to
compile them step by step?

ii) Is it possible to compile certain parts of Maxima with CLISP? Would it
be functional?

If somebody can answer me and somehow give me any hint, I'd really
appreciate. I need some documentation mainly...

Thanks in advance,
Lizardo.

Dear developers of Maxima,

I have tried to compile gcl-2.4.0 under Red-Hat Linux 7.1 (gcc 2.96-81).
The configure script seemed to work O.K., but at the end it writes the
message

"patching o/makefile for gcc bug in 2.96".

When I run "make", it ends (after some work) with an error

All of maxima should work with clisp including the xmaxima interface should work
with clisp as well as gcl.   Please take the latest cvs snapshot for this though...

To make old code work, maxima accepts all of the original commands (defined
in the base lisp) in any case.    RatSimp, RATSIMP, ratsimp will all work.

However for commands which are not in the base image, the case is important.

Joe(x):=x+2;
joe(x):=x+3;
JOE(x):=x+4;

will all be distinct functions.

For some reason it seems to be using the old 'mp' stuff.  gcl 2.4
should be using the 'gmp' stuff, which is much more efficient, and it
is unclear the old 'mp' stuff will still work in it.

Please use the latest snapshot of gcl or update from the cvs...

In-Reply-To: <200107031809.NAA30302@linux34.ma.utexas.edu>
Message-ID: <20010703215549.86058.qmail@web14707.mail.yahoo.com>

I am interested in obtaining solutions to equations involving exp(x),
that is %E^x. 

For a very simple example, consider:

(C1) h(x):=x*exp(-x);
(C2) solve(h(x)=1/4);
				      x
				    %E
(D2) 			       [x = ---]
				     4

Of course, Maxima is correct to say that x=exp(x)/4 "solves" the above
equation, but that is not really what one is looking for.

Numerically, one can verify that x=0.36 and x= 2.15 would make
h(x)=0.25.

But, how to get Maxima to give this answer??

I tried different "switches" for "solve" but could not find anyone that
would lead to a numerical solution.

I also found and tried the function zsolve, whose description sounds
promising, but could not get it to work. 
Unfortunately, this function appears to be undocumented.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

WOW! That was quick, Boris! It almost looks as if you sent your answer
before I asked the question! :-)
And it even works (I have already tried it)! 
I also found a way to get the other solution.

Thank you very much!

--Virgil
P.S. I am replying to the list in case someone else may want to know.
It seems that Maxima's initial help/tutorial does not address the issue
of how to obtain numerical solutions when explicit symbolic solutions
are not available.

You could use 'newton'

(C1) load("newton")$
(C2) fpprec:100$
(C3) NEWTON(x*exp(-x)-bfloat(1/4),x,bfloat(0),1.0b-100);

Hi,

I have CLISP 2.25.1 running on Darwin (Mac OS 10.0.4).

I wish you could help me porting it for Darwin:

i) First, I don't have a Fortran compiler yet, hence, I think I won't be
able to compile the numerical package, is it right?

ii) Second, I want to disable the ploting features and xmaxima for the
moment and just have a command-line tool.

I couldn't find a good tutorial or HOWTO in order to build it and, so far,
the README didn't say much, that's why I'm asking for help.

I want to:
a) Build "maxima" under the constraints above on my home directory and test
it.

b)Provide a Carbon application later on.

I need some introductory remarks or ---even better--- a step by step
tutorial describing each component of "src" directory and how to build it
with CLISP (if possible ;).

Any tip is welcome.
Thanks in advance,
Lizardo.

Well, there's a "src/compile-clisp.lisp" file, what suggests that Maxima was
already built using CLISP. Unfortunately it wasn't well documented. I
searched in the mailing archives and couldn't find much too.

Any tip would be great.
Thanks in advance,
Lizardo.

(D5) chi^2*om23^2+43
(C6) ratsubst(omega23, chi * om23, chi^2 * om23^2 + 43);

If this doesn't work, you can instead try something like

subst(omega23 / chi, om23, ...)

P.S.  Many thanks for the folks who helped me with Poisson and helped me
find the format package the other week; format has worked well for me and it even
contains an enhanced Poisson package.  Finally,
 (setq machine-mantissa-precision (float-digits 1.0d0)) works for me.

no it is not needed

It compiles without errors, but a few warnings. At the end I get:

Message-ID: <20010709200033.72341.qmail@web14706.mail.yahoo.com>

Some math-related software packages (e.g. Matlab) provide a "diary"
option. This enables the user to request that a text file be created
with a copy of a session, including all commands entered by the user
and the corresponding replies by the software. 

This feature is convenient sometimes, although it may be substituted by
conducting the session from within a text editor, such as e-macs.

An even handier feature may be the generation of a (La-)TeX "diary",
that is, a TeX file corresponding to user inputs and program outputs!

Now, Maxima can provide TeX translation, one expression at a time
(tex(%) for example).

Can Maxima "automatically" generate:
a) an ASCII (text) "diary" file 
b) a TeX "diary" file ?

If (a) is available but not (b), it would seem desirable and relatively
simple to extend (a) to (b) by way of the tex command.

Thanks.

__Virgil
P.S. I am aware that an interface between TeXmacs and Maxima apparently
exists and may provide some of the functionality of option (b) above.

The command "writefile(filespecification);"
has the diary function.
you have to closefile()  afterward.

If you want each command to be TeX'd, I suppose it can be
done by replacing the command-display function, perhaps
found in the main loop of the "continue" lisp function in SUPRV1.lisp

But first try this:

writefile(texdiary);

map(tex,reverse(labels)); 
closefile();


which might produce a tex'd diary of commands and displays.

Subject: [Maxima] Maxima on CLISP under Darwin
Message-ID: <200107100401.BAA16668@xena.urbi.com.br>

Hi,

I'm running clisp 2.25.1 on Darwin 1.3.7 (Mac OS 10.0.4).

Now I'm trying to port Maxima using CLISP, since GCL have been being hard to
build. I know some of you already did it. I'm a newbie and need some
directions here.

Would somebody please could be kind enough to give me some instructions,
kind of a recipe, or even a starting point?

So far I did
cd src
make clisp-compile CLISP=clisp

I got a couple of warning and no errors, but Maxima isn't working. That's
what I get retrying "make":
; Loading file macsys.fas ...
;; Loading of file macsys.fas is finished.
;; Loading file mload.fas ...
;; Loading of file mload.fas is finished.
;; Loading file suprv1.fas ...
*** - READ from #<BUFFERED FILE-STREAM CHARACTER #P"suprv1.fas" @36>: there
is no character bit with name "NO"
Bye.

I'd relly appreciate any tip.
Thanks a lot,
Lizardo.

I am interested in the related project of running Maxima on a PowerPC
Macintosh operating under LinuxPPC 2000Q4.

I already have installed CLISP and it appears to be running well.

I would prefer to find a ppp.rpm file of Maxima 5.6, but it appears
that no one has made it available on the web.

In any case, if anyone has successfully installed Maxima 5.6 on
LinuxPPC (or another distribution for the PPC chip), and is willing to
provide advise or guidelines, please let me know. Please, reply to my
e-mail. I'll send a summary of my experience to the list later on.

Thanks in advance.

I have clisp-2.26 running on SGI Irix 6.5.  After changing two
lines in clisp-compile.lisp I get stuck at the same message.
For the record, the changes were simply to replace "lisp:..." with
"ext:...":

;  (lisp:gc)
;  (lisp:saveinitmem "maxima-clisp.mem"
;                   :init-function #'user::run)
  (ext:gc)
  (ext:saveinitmem "maxima-clisp.mem"
                  :init-function #'user::run)

The block that appears to be the problem in suprv1.lisp is:

		(cond (#-cl (< (cadr x)
				  160)
			    #+cl (char< (cadr x)
					#. (code-char 160.))
				       (ASCII (CADR X)))
				      (t (cadr x)))))

In clisp I get:
   [1]> (code-char 160.)
      #\NO-BREAK_SPACE

I don't know where the "NO-BREAK_SPACE" is defined, and I wonder
if it shouldn't be "NO_BREAK_SPACE", or if it is really needed
at all for maxima.

For whatever reason, writefile(myfile) [or writefile("myfile")] does
create the file "myfile"...but NOTHING is added to the file. (This has
nothing to do with TeX)

For example, the session below, results in the creation of the file
"texdiary2" in my home directory, but it remains empty *after* the
closefile() command.


(C6) writefile("texdiary2");
Starts dribbling to texdiary2 (2001/7/10, 12:52:1).

(D9) 				      [x = 3, x = 2]

Finished dribbling to texdiary2.

Hi,
I'm trying to port GCL, a COMMON LISP compiler,
ftp://ftp.ma.utexas.edu/pub/gcl/gcl-2.4.0.tgz

I'll use it to build Maxima,
http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/maxima.html
sort of a Maple and Mathematica clone.

Unfortunately, my experience with GNU tools is restricted to the
compilation of numerical programs in C and Fortran. So, if you're
interested in one of these packages and want to help me, I'd really
appreciate.

PLEASE, give me a reply if you have any ideas and I apologize for
bothering some of you...

Below is what I've done so far (I know there are easier ways to do it ):

First, edit the "FreeBSD.defs" located at the "<Where you keep GCL>/h"
folder according to Darwin and its compiler (I can send you a copy of
mine.)
In the directory "<where you keep GCL>" type
# ./add-defs FreeBSD

#make -n
and you'll see what steps "make" shall attempt to do

#cd bin
edit "Makefile" according to folders and compiler.
#make
Shouldl run without errors...
#cd..

Now follow " make mpfiles -n ". First,
#cp -v /usr/libexec/con* < Where you keep GCL and path>/gmp
That will replace "config.guess" and "config.sub" in the folder above.
#cd gmp; ./configure
#cd ..

# make mpfiles -k
and you'll get several syntax errors during the compilation of files *.s
( An example:
#cc -c -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -DOPERATION_rshift    -g -O2
-mpowerpc tmp-rshift.s -o rshift.o  )

Finally,
#cd o
Edit Makefile
#make -k
There are 4 files that should be compiled yet...

We could go further, but should heal "make mpfiles" first... I'm sure
that somebody will come up with something that should work.
Thanks,
Lizardo.

I tried this, but now get the error:

  ;; Loading file suprv1.fas ...
  *** - CHAR-CODE: argument (CNTLC #\Etx) is not a character
  Bye.

I think the replacement should read:

    #+cl  (< (char-code (cadr x)) 160)


With this, compilation proceeds much further, but stops at:

Compiling file /disk2/gwhite/src/maxima-5.6/src/mactex.lisp ...
*** - READ from #<BUFFERED FILE-STREAM CHARACTER
  #P"/disk2/gwhite/src/maxima-5.6/src/mactex.lisp" @1>: illegal character
#\Us
Bye.

The file mactex.lisp appears to be corrupt.  It is 9289 bytes, dated May
18 06:26.  I had a version that is 26076 bytes from Apr  2 20:19.
With this change, I was able to get a maxima-clisp.mem, but there is
a problem with the tests:

(cd ../doc ; clisp -M ../src/maxima-clisp.mem tests.lisp)
*** - READ from #<BUFFERED FILE-STREAM CHARACTER #P"tests.lisp" @10>:
there is no package with name "SI"
gmake: *** [test-clisp] Error 1

I can, however, run simple examples, e.g., cut and pasted from the
manual.demo file.

Hi, 

If this is too OFF_TOPIC, please let me know...

I downloaded "a.out.h" from the Internet and now there are just for 2 files
that should be compiled in the "<Where you keep GCL folder>/o":

i) unixsave.c ( it can't find unexec.c and other errors... )
ii) sfals.c ( in FreeBSD.h there's RELOC_FILE="rel_sun3.c ")

I don't know what would be the right RELOC_FILE for Darwin.

Also, if somebody have any idea and want to help me somehow, I'd really
appreciate...

Thanks in advance,

P.S.: " make mpfiles -n " says nothing to be done for all; but
#cd < ... GCL folder>/gmp/mpn
#make -n
Says that I have to compile a couple of "*.s" sources... Problems with that?

Common Lisp is by default case insensitive.  This is a really
bad design decision, in my opinion, and I objected to it
when it was proposed that way by people at MIT and Stanford and CMU who
had extensive experience with Maclisp and other case-insensitive
lisps of the 1960's. But they prevailed. People with Unix experience
who enjoyed BOTH cases, lost.

Indeed Macsyma was written originally in Maclisp which was
case insensitive.  This was on DEC PDP-6 and DEC-10 systems with
36 bit words where every bit counted.

After commenting out the line in doc/tests.lisp starting with "(si: ..."
that caused an error, run the commands from the "test-clisp" target
in src/makefile:

$ cd ../doc
$ clisp -core ../src/maxima.core -load ../src/maxima-clisp.mem tests.lisp

I'm still thinking about installing maxima and I have some questions
about recovering from errors, but certainly I can do the things I
need with very little additional work.

I have just learned
that there will be a release of Allegro Common Lisp 6.1beta
on OS-X from Franz Inc very shortly.

Using it would put the burden of support of the Lisp on a commercial
outfit instead of volunteers.  It would not, however, be free.

There is some conditionalization for Allegro in the Maxima code,
but I have not tried to recompile it in its entirely in Allegro
for some time.

There are undoubtedly  points of comparison among GCL, CLISP
and Allegro other than price.

The point is that I can't afford a commercial package.

Yet, I'm not acquainted to COMMON LISP and it's hard to port MAXIMA with
CLISP while I can't find much documentation. (If somebody could address
me...)

But I still think that Maxima would be a great package for Mac OS X, given
the facilities OSX has...

Lizardo.

I'm not going do discuss about your time, but about mine, since, as you
said, you're a volunteer and just help me if you want.

I only regret that free softwares available aren't in general well
documented for beginners like me. But this kind of attitude is changing
fast.

I think it's justifiable to waist some of time in a project which
universities like mine would be able to profit. In fact, I don't believe
that using free tools to build a nice package like Maxima for uncommon
platforms like mine is a big waist of time.

But yes, maybe I'm underrating my time...

The standard install is for gcl.

You can just leave maxima where you built it, or move the directory...

To invoke maxima you must tell it where the documentation and files are
the easiest is to set an environment variable and then invoke the command.
You can make a shell script:

eg:
==================maxima==============
#!/bin/bash
export MAXIMA_DIRECTORY
MAXIMA_DIRECTORY=/directory-where-i-put-it/maxima-5.6
exec clisp  -M ${MAXIMA_DIRECTORY}/src/maxima-clisp.mem
=====================

===============xmaxima===================
#!/bin/bash
export MAXIMA_DIRECTORY
MAXIMA_DIRECTORY=/directory-where-i-put-it/maxima-5.6
exec ${MAXIMA_DIRECTORY}/bin/xmaxima  -lisp clisp
============================

Message-ID: <54lmloe5zb.fsf@intech19.enhanced.com>

Greetings!  I've been looking at a number of the numerical routines
listed by the info pages as accessible under maxima, but I can't get
any of them to work.  Like zsolve, for example.  Are these routines
still available?

If not, is there any other convenient way to numerically, rather than
symbolically, process a given stage of a maxima session?  Can one for
example approximate the root of d=%E^d-1.5?

Is there any interest in providing some numerical functions, say from
the gsl library, under maxima?  If so, is there a howto or simple
example? I could probably add what I need.

Take care,

Hi Camm,

 Certainly!  At the beginning of a session, type numer:true - this will let
you do nearly everything in floating point.  There is a routine in the share
directory for Newton's method for your nonlinear equation.  I've done a few
numerical routines by essentially transcribing published Fortran or C codes.

Subject: [Maxima] Latex x Tex function
Message-ID: <15188.20187.358441.726397@angola.grante.ufsc.br>

Just a suggestion. Possibly most people use Latex rather than Tex. I
am not suggesting anything like that Latex is worst or better than
pure Tex. Possibly pure Tex is really better than Latex but I started
with latex ...

In this case the tex function could be improved or maybe created a
latex version in a not so near future. 

Firstly I must refrain that my migration from Mathematica is being
incredibly smooth and also that the Tex output from Maxima is
ABSOLUTELY better than the equivalent Mathematica function. 

I will present a Maxima session as an example

C83) mat:MATRIX([X+3*COS(X)^2-SIN(X)^2,0],[X+3*COS(X)^3-SIN(X),1]);
					[      2	   2	       ]
					[ - SIN (X) + 3 COS (X) + X  0 ]
(D83) 				        [ 			       ]
					[		  3	       ]
					[ - SIN(X) + 3 COS (X) + X   1 ]
(C84) trigreduce(%);
				  [ COS(2 X)	  COS(2 X)   1	      1	    ]
				  [ -------- + 3 (-------- + -) + X - -	  0 ]
				  [    2	     2	     2	      2	    ]
(D84) 				  [ 					    ]
				  [    COS(3 X)	  3 COS(X)		    ]
				  [ 3 (-------- + --------) - SIN(X) + X  1 ]
				  [	  4	     4			    ]

I've a little library built up myself.  Have you interfaced into

Subject: [Maxima] Installation and Integration Errors
Message-ID: <01071716214802.01660@guanaco.lignumcomputing.org>

Hi,

I just downloaded and installed the latest releases of GCL-2.4.0 and 
Maxima-5.6 on a RedHat 7.1/i386. I ran into a couple of problems.

In the configure script for GCL, there's a little EMACS function which tries 
to find the site-lisp, defaults.el and lisp info/dir. In the version of EMACS 
which is shipped with RH 7.1, EMACS produces different output from what is 
expected by the sed command, namely:

[root at guanaco gcl-2.4.0]# emacs -q -batch -l conftest.el                     
Loading /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.d/aspell-init.el (source)...
Loading /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.d/lang.emacs.el (source)...
Loading /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.d/po-mode-init.el (source)...
Loading /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.d/psgml-init.el (source)...
Finished loading /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/egg/leim-list.el
   and load others...
./default.el

The 'Finished loading..' and ' and load others...' are not properly filtered 
out by the sed command. (So, I changed it to 'sed -e /[Ll]oad/' in each of 
three places this is used and it got through configure OK.)

After I built Maxima, I was trying out some old .mc files and I found that 
integration seems to be broken. For example:

[root at guanaco gcl-2.4.0]# maxima

                              2      2     2      2

                                2            2
(C3) quit();

I then downloaded the latest snapshot of Maxima. This would not complete 
compilation because the file src/mactex.lisp appears to contain binary data.

Whew. It's not been my day.

Thanks,
Allen

maxima -f script.max

and then it loads the file without having to enter maxima manually and run the script with BASH().

z(c):=NEWTON(%E^d-d-c,d,1.0,0.01) fails because, it seems to me, you
cannot define a "generic" function in terms of the newton function
applied with an unknown parameter.

I believe I did something similar to what you want by using:
i) create_list
ii) openplot_curves

It would go something like:

load("newton");
cpts:create_list(j/10,j,12,23);
pts:create_list([c,NEWTON(%E^d-d-c,d,1.0,0.001)],c,cpts);
openplot_curves([pts]);

See also http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/wfs/netmath/pmaxima.html

Good luck!

Subject: [Maxima] Missing something?
Message-ID: <200107191626.NAA25246@xena.urbi.com.br>

I compiled Maxima following the steps below in "./src":
# make clisp-compile CLISP=clisp
# make maxima-clisp.mem CLISP=clisp
# make test-clisp CLISP=clisp

Yet, I can't use xmaxima, omplotdata and so forth. It seems I've skiped a
couple of steps or something escapes me; for instance, I can't use plot2d().

Any help is welcome.
Lizardo.

Greetings!  First let me preface this by saying that maxima is more
than fast enough for my needs, and that I haven't as yet fully
explored all its functionality.  But I did notice the discussion on
bignums, and how gcl/maxima can now benefit from the enhanced
performance offered by gmp.  My questions:

1) Could maxima realistically benefit from using optimized blas
   routines, as does octave?
2) Could maxima realistically benefit from using MPI and running over
   a cluster?

Obviously, the answer to 1 and 2 could only be yes with a problem size
much much larger than anything I personally have seen so far.  I'm
just interested if any other users have seen such large problems.

Separately

3) Is there any way to use gcl as a stand-alone compiler, making object
   files which can be linked with fortran and C object files into the
   final executable?  It seems as though the way to use gcl to make a
   stand-alone program such as maxima is rather by dumping its memory
   image or some such after loading the maxima lisp source.

Take care,

   1) Could maxima realistically benefit from using optimized blas

Maxima does not have much numerical code, for such computations octave
is better and it is also covered by the GNU license.   It might be
good to add code to invoke the fortran routines:   I once made a file
( src/fortdef.lisp) which set up calls to a subsidiary fortran program
using xdr data exchange.   I am afraid I dont know if this still works,
see the example at the end of that file.

   2) Could maxima realistically benefit from using MPI and running over

I think it will in the long run, and I will be making gcl have multiprocessor
abilities, sometime in the coming year.    Then we will have to find appropriate
places to use this in maxima.

   3) Is there any way to use gcl as a stand-alone compiler, making object

You can of course compile lisp files and load them with 'load'.     If you
want these to reference some external C or fortran then that C or fortran
has to be linked into the base image (by adding it to the list of files
at link time when gcl/maxima is built).     You can compile lisp files and
link them together:  that is how gcl is built, all the .c files in the lsp and
cmpnew directories are compiled from .lsp files, and then compiled with gcc
and then linked into the image.     Any program that is going to run however
will need things like the garbage collector, storage allocation, bignum routines
etc linked in ... ie basically the files of gcl.

Hope this answers the questions at least somewhat.

Subject: [Maxima] Plotting with Maxima?
Message-ID: <200107221321.KAA01976@xena.urbi.com.br>

I used CLISP to get Maxima working for Darwin. It works fine, except for the
fact that I can't use plotting features.

For instance,

(C1) plot2d(sin(x), [x,-5,5]);
zsh: command not found: omplotdata
(D1)

I wonder what I have to do in order to get it working. I have XFree 4.0.2
and tclsh8.3

Thanks in advance,

Maxima does run in Allegro, which now has various multiprocessing
capabilities.  

The search for appropriate places to use parallelism
in computer algebra has been going on for at least 30 years, with
very limited success.  There are some opportunities for conversion
of symbolic questions into questions in linear algebra where parallel
algorithms have been deployed (numerical routines), so maybe there
will be some hope for the future.  There are parallel Grobner
basis fans, but even best-case linear speedup of an exponential cost
algorithm
tends to have limits.

So far as I know, all TeX commands related to equations work identically
in LaTex.  I don't understand the error message about the } ... I cut
and pasted the answer into emacs and found the {} to be balanced.

There is a possibility of improving the appearance by adding small
spaces;  the source code would certainly allow the replacements
of 1\over2 etc   by \frac{1}{2}, but this would break the code
for users of TeX.  A command latex  in addition to tex could
be set up, if the alternatives are important.

I'm new to maxima and i'm finding the manual really confusing!
I want to be able to save a 2d or 3d plot without using interaction (the plot window's menu). What i need is to be able to write a script file that plots a function in to a postscript file (or any other graphical format). How can i make this?, is there a place where i can find other maxima docs?

Thanks for your help.

Hi - You can use plot2dps in the same way as plot2d, and you can also put
all of your Maxima commands into a text file which you can run in the
following way: batch("c:\blah.mc"); where blah.mc is the text file.  You
also have to use the closeps command to initialize and terminate the
plot(s).  I hope this helps...

[ cos(q4+q3+q2)*cos(q1)]
[ sin(q4+q3+q2)*cos(q1)]
[ sin(q4+q3+q2)        ]

which I intend to make another substitution like

[c234*c1]
[s234*c1]
[s234   ]

as the process fails at the first time the result becomes incredibly
large.

Subject: [Maxima] problem with is();
Message-ID: <3B695CAB.4040207@purdue.edu>

Hello again,

First a question:  I am trying to test some complicated inequalities. 
 Since they don't seem to be true in general, I need to figure out the 
conditions on k, ka and kc which make them true. I'm  wondering if there 
is some easier way to do this than assume() and is() and lots of 
intervention?  Do we have something like a whenis() function, which 
would return a set of conditions under which an inequality holds?

Second, I think that I may have found a problem with Maxima's reasoning: 
 I wonder if this is a bug, or whether I'm expecting too much of Maxima. 
 C28 is true, as it should be.  I think C29 should be true, too, by 
transitivity and C31.  I added curly-braces in D30; they  should line up 
vertically, for in case the formatting gets messed up.


(C28) is(3*k-1<kc);

(D28)                      TRUE
(C29) is(3*k-1<2*kc);

MACSYMA was unable to evaluate the predicate:
ERREXP1
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)
(C30) facts(initial);

                                                                         
   {2 - ka    }  {kc + 1    }        { 3 k  }
(D30) [kc + ka - 1 > 0, 1 > ka, 1 > kc, k > {------}, {------} > k,{ 
---} > kc,
                                                                        
    { 3            }  { 3           }         {  2    }

                    ka + 3 k - 2 > 0, kc - 3 k + 1 > 0, kc > 0]
(C31) is(kc<2*kc);

(D31)                      TRUE
(C32) is(3*k-1<2*kc);

MACSYMA was unable to evaluate the predicate:
ERREXP1
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)

By the way, this is Maxima 5.6 on gcl 2.4 on Redhat 7.1.

Dear List-members,

Acc. to an article in Fibonacci Quarterly Vol.37.2, May 1991, 
the geometry of the Fibonacciseries is a hyperbola with asymp-
totes x = -2 and x + y = 1. I would very much like to know the 
equations and the excentricity of this hyperbola.

I would also like to know the solutions to the following two 
equations hopefully giving the reason for their differnce:   

a.  x^2 + 2x + y^2 = -2  {� (Empty Set)} 

b.  x^2 + 2x + y^2 = -1  {point (-1,0)}

Rewrite these two equations as

(x+1)^2 + y^2 = 0.

Real squares are positive, so the first one cannot be solved. The
second one implies that x+1=y=0.

Message-ID: <15227.40825.455598.991965@lxplus034.cern.ch>

	Greetings,

First, thanks a lot to whoever adopted maxima to run under
cmucl. There were however still a few quirks I had to bypass for it to
actually run correctly, this made me wonder if I should look for newer
cmucl specific patches? I didn't have much luck with the CVS
version. Anyway, bypassing the quirks, maxima passes all the tests in
doc/tests.lisp, and blazingly fast:-)

Here is a summary of my fixes, intermixed with relevant diffs:

*   *QUO is declared to be inline and ftype (function (* *) *), while
    actually being ftype (function (number number) (values number
    &optional integer)) This combination caused cmucl 18c x86f to
    generate incorrect code, assuming the function would never be
    called with integer arguments. The symptom of this was the COMPPI
    function never returning. Putting a PROGN around the TRUNCATE to
    explicitly get rid of the extra return value solves the problem

  expressions like x:0.1; abs(x^2-10); throwing a lisp error. I guess
  it would be possible to explicitly undefine macros before saving the

  then restart cmucl, run (COMPILE-MAXIMA) (This loads the already
  compiled hyp.x86f respecting the intention of its EVAL-WHEN) and
  finally (SAVE-MAXIMA)

I have a few patches but they have to do with plotting.  They're not

This progn shouldn't change anything.  Don't you mean (values
(truncate x y)) so that returns exactly one value?

Doesn't that mean that the eval-when is either wrong or CMUCL is not
doing the right thing with the eval-when?  The current CVS versions of
CMUCL has an ANSI compliant eval-when implementation now.

So you got the basics to work without the problems I had? IIRC, you're
on sparc and run cmucl from CVS, that could be the reason.

I had (if (...) (prog1 (truncate x y)) (/ x y)). Trying to
hand edit for a minimal diff I accidentally changed PROG1 -> PROGN
:-(Shame on me)-:

BTW: (prog1 form) works like (values form), is that a bug?

I'm wondering: If I compile a file containing,
(eval-when (eval compile) (defmacro foo ...)  ...),
is it correct for FOO to be defined as a macro in the lisp image where
the compilation takes place? Or should the DEFMACRO only have effect
for the compilation unit? I saw something relating to this in the
hyperspec, but I didn't really understand it.

Here is what happens to me: I compile hyp.lisp, MABS gets defined as a
macro in that image. I dump and restart maxima.core, MABS is still
defined as a macro in my image. On the other hand, if I start a fresh
lisp and load hyp.x86f, MABS is not defined as a macro because of the
EVAL-WHEN. It would be interesting to know if the CVS version behaves
differently from my stock 18c. I am not, however, a CMUCL compiling
person.

Hello,

I'm new with this and finding it hard to learn how to use
Maxima with the info page and manual. Do you know of any
introductory manuals or tutorials? Also, has anyone posted
maxima code on varied (simple) problems so one can learn from
looking at it? If not is anyone willing to do this?

Thanks,

Federico

Unfortunately not, except what comes along Maxima (be sure to
get the most recent Maxima manual, it seems to improve fast in
the direction of having a tutorial in the beginning)

There is this book:

MACSYMA FOR STATISTICIANS
Barbara Heller
Wiley Series in Probability and Mathematical Statistics
ISBN 0-471-62590-6

I think it's very good for beginners, try to find it (eg. from library).

I see the same behavior with my CVS version, but I don't know exactly
what version that is.

Also, I just replaced (eval-when (eval compile)...) with just
(eval-when (compile)...) in hyp.lisp.  It solves your immediate
problem about MABS et al being defined.  That is, if I save a core
file without exiting, MABS is not defined, and your test example works
as expected.

Friends:
Maxima/GCL users:

  I heard from a colleague, and then
confirmed via Prof Robert Boyer at UTexas, that
Bill Schelter died.  The last message I saw,
sent from Russia, was dated July 26.


Here is the note I received from Bob Boyer...

....................

It is so very sad but true, Bill Schelter has died.

Bill went to Moscow, this summer, got married, and died of a heart
attack at
the end of July.  He was buried in Canada a few weeks ago.

His wife is named Olga Vodianikova, but I don't have an address for her.

His daughter can be reached at

  Mike and Karen Schelter Lewis
  1705 Autumn Fire Drive
  Cedar Park, TX 78613

His son Johh, a med student, can also be reached at that address.

>From what little I know, Prof. Michael Artin, artin at math.mit.edu, may be the
person most up-to-date on the details of the story.

Sincerely,

Bob Boyer

This is very sad news indeed.

I never meet Bill Schelter, but he answered my questions about maxima
accurately, quickly, and respectfully.  I'll remember him for that.  The
enormous effort he put into gcc,  gcl, and especially maxima was a great
gift to  the computing  world. He will be missed.

I just read this news yesterday, and have been deeply saddened by it
ever since.  I never had the honor of meeting Dr. Schelter in person,
but I knew him via email as an extremely helpful, outstandingly
knowledgeable, persevering and diligent servant to the mathematical
education and empowerment of the public.  To say that he will be
missed doesn't begin to do justice to our loss.  In him resided a
confluence of skills and will which, quite honestly, I haven't even
the slightest vision of how they can be replaced.  And this is indeed
tragic, as I feel he would be most gratified to know that his gift to
humanity would live beyond him.  Perhaps, in time, a small army might
be found to attempt to fill his shoes, however inadequately.

Let me add my voice to those deeply saddened by this news.
The work he did on GCL and Maxima was impressive.  
I only corresponded with him a few times, through email, but he was
always helpful and respectful.
He will be missed.

Are these errors from "make test" normal for maxima 5.6 with gcl

I don't believe this is normal.  On the Debian builds, the number of
differences reported is always 0.

1.  For no errors under RedHat 6.2,  I had to add at least one kill(all)
statement to the
rtest*.mac files (in particular to rtest4.mac).  With more RAM, this might
not be needed.

2.  Some maxima-5.6 RPMs you find on the web are broken;  try building
maxima
from the latest development sources (there are several maxima-5.6
versions).

For what it's worth, I've been getting similar errors (about 20 of them) 
when running the checks.  Seems to be mostly in the integration 
routines, but I haven't had time to dig into it, since I don't need it 
right now.  I've had this problem with Mandrake 8.1, and Redhat 7.1, 
with Maxima 5.6.

Hope this helps,

    OK, I tried the kill(all) suggestion in rtest3.mac.  I got
    the same results.  I tried recompiling from the Maxima most
    recent source (from the main Maxima page, which is also where
    I got my 5.6 tarball) and got exactly the same 'make test'
    results.

    Here's one example of a broken test.

/* ********************** Problem 89. *************** */
%Input is
INTEGRATE(EXP, X)
Division by 0
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)

Caused a error break: rtest3.mac
Error Summary: [BROKE, (QUOTE, rtest3)]

    Since the error output said to try DEBUGMODE(TRUE), I added

	debugmode(true);
	done;

    in rtest3.mac just before the failing test.  Rerunning the
    test produced (just the bad parts):

/* ********************** Problem 90. *************** */
%Input is
INTEGRATE(EXP, X)
Division by 0
-- an error.  Entering the Maxima Debugger dbm
(dbm:1)
FALSE
(dbm:1)
FALSE
(dbm:1)
FALSE

    The (dbm:1) FALSE pattern continues seemingly forever.


    Any ideas people?  Many thanks....

I've solved the problem of compiling gcl and maxima on Mandrake
8.0 and getting all the self-tests to pass.  Forgive me while
I waste some bandwidth in order to get this solution into the
mailing list archive.  I hope that will help someone in the
future and maybe even prevent future bandwidth wasting. ;-)

A half-dozen or so folks contacted me off list.  All indicated
that gcl & maxima should compile on Linux and that "make test"
should pass all tests.  No one had a specific solution.  Some
assumed that I'm running Redhat and mentioned that gcc-2.96
can cause some tests to fail.  I run Mandrake 8.0 which, like
Redhat, uses the "controversial" gcc-2.96 compiler.  Luckily
the kernel needs a working compiler.  On Mandrake 8, this is in
/usr/bin/kgcc and is "gcc version egcs-2.91.66".  I took all this
advice and read all about Redhat in h/386-linux.defs.

What I needed to do (leaving out a few details) is:

 - configure gcl with CC=kgcc

 - hand craft the gcl-2.2.2_rh50linux.patch to work with
   gcl-2.4.0.

 - patch 386-linux.defs to make sure that "-static" is turned on
   in the "LDCC=${CC} -static" line.

 - make gcl with GCC=kgcc and OFLAG=-g

 - configure maxima with CC=kgcc

 - make maxima with GCC=kgcc

As for those few details, I've attached my RPM spec files for
gcl and maxima and the small patch files they reference.

Cheerio...

Greetings, and thanks for posting this!  I'm glad you got it working,
but it seems that what you had to do is quite sad.  You basically had
to turn off all optimization, and make a static binary.  I maintain
the maxima package for Debian, and Dr. Schelter had helped me address
most of these issues a long time ago.  The package currently produces
a stripped, dynamically linked binary with compiler optimization that
passes all tests using gcc 2.95.  I'm only telling you this in case
you might want to pursue this further.  You can download the tar.gz
and diff.gz source files for maxima from the Debian website, unpack
the tar file, and apply the diff with the patch program.  You could
then examine the differences in the config files from those in
your source tree.  In any case, kgcc on your distro is a good idea.
But if you'd like to contribute your rpm to mandrake or otherwise
distribute it, it would be best if it could be optimized, stripped,
and dynamically linked.  

P.S.  I had thought that all the changes Dr. Schelter had given me
relating to these issues were included in cvs.  I'll try to confirm
this when I get a chance.

P.P.S. Does anyone know if the cvs tree for maxima and gcl will remain
at their current locations?  As far as I knew, Dr. Schelter was the
only one with write access.

Take care,

Yes, both maxima and gcl repository will stay in their
current location indefinitely.  If someone (or a group) 
wants to take over the responsibility of maintaining these 
packages, I'll be more than happy to help making the repository
accessible.

    OK, I think I've got a better solution.  I turned the
    optimization and dynamic linking back on and everything
    still passes "make test".  The main problems seems to be
    that gcc 2.96 doesn't produce good code.  My solution for
    that is to use /usr/bin/kgcc.  If anyone wants my RPM
    spec files for gcl and/or maxima, please write and I'll
    send them to you.  If there are too many requests, then
    I'll send them to the list again.

    Cheers....

This sounds bit of strange to me... I have had no problems with

Slackware 7.1 + maxima 5.6 (I think the last cvs tree I downloaded
was more or less in july, but sorry not to remember) + gcl 2.4.0
(also not remember the date)... egcs-1.1.2 Pentium III 933Mhz + 128Mb
runs all the tests OK.

Hope this may help to enlighten things a bit.

Regards,

	Pedro.

    The fact that you used egcs-1.1.2 to compile would make me
    think everything would test fine.  I believe the problem is
    with gcc-2.96 specificly.  If I avoid that version of the
    compiler, then I have no problems.

    Cheers...

Sorry to be asking such a doofus question, but can
anyone show me how to take the grad and curl in
maxima?  I know about the load(vect); thing but beyond
that I'm lost.  Any help appreciated.

Thanks,

1.  Load vect.mc from the share directory; vector.mc in the share2
    directory is broken.

2.  In vect.mc, I had to change the two define_variable statements from

       DEFINE_VARIABLE(sfprod,1,any)$
       DEFINE_VARIABLE(sf,[1,1,1],list)$

    to

       DEFINE_VARIABLE(SFPROD,1,any)$
       DEFINE_VARIABLE(SF,[1,1,1],list)$

     (I don't understand why SF and SFPROD must be uppercase here; with my
      maxima, they do need to be.)

3.  Try the following:

(C1) load("vect.mc");

Warning - you are redefining the MACSYMA function TRIGSIMP
Warning - you are redefining the MACSYMA function IMPROVE
Warning - you are redefining the MACSYMA function UPDATE
(D1)                         vect.mc

/* By default, the coordinate system is cartesian with coordinates
X,Y, and Z (upper case, not lower case)  */

(C2) grad(X^2 + Y^2);

                           2    2
(D2)                        GRAD (Y  + X )
(C3) express(%);

             d        2    2  d      2       2   d    2       2
(D3)             [-- (Y  + X ), -- (Y  + X ), -- (Y  + X )]
             dX              dY                  dZ
(C4) ev(%,diff);

(D4)                      [2 X, 2 Y, 0]
(C5)


4.  There is some documentation in vect.usg; compared to the rest of maxima, the
      vector code isn't as well tested.  I'd be careful about trusting it for much more
     than homework.

person, _presumably_ in this list.
However, I send this message for good reasons,
as you will see now.
 
Andr'e Jaccomard, a member of the French 
association AsTeX, 
http://www.univ-orleans.fr/EXT/ASTEX 
is now translating the Maxima manual.

Somebody sent me a message, a few weeks ago,
proposing to do so, too. 
Needless to say, I forgot his address :-(

The work of translating
the Maxima manual is near completed, but some
obscurities remain. 
And Bill is not alive...
Perhaps the explanations are in the GCL manual,
so we are now planing the translation of it.

Please, friend, if you want to translate this
manual, send me an e-mail:
dduparc at club-internet.fr
or/and  to Michel Lavaud, father of AsTeX:
Michel.Lavaud at univ-orleans.fr

Best regards.

Hello

I'm also trying to promote the use of maxima in the french community. 
For this, i have opened a french site for maxima, trying to put 
translated documents for downloading. The adress :
http://www.maxima.fr.st
This site is only at the beginning, so it is very incomplete.
I will be glad to put the translated maxima manual on the site.

Best regards.

Hi,

New to Maxima here. Running 5.6 with GCL 2.4.0

Can anyone recommend good intro level material and/or examples of
using Maxima to do some relatively simple vector operations? If I can
only figure out how to do thing like start with symbolic expressions:

v1 = [a, b, c];
v2 = [e, f, g];

and get to the cross product, expanded out:

          [ b g - f c   ]
          [ -a g + e c  ]
          [ a f - e b   ]

I really have been trying to follow the docs but I could really
benefit from seeing a simple example.

thanks!

Judah

This doesn't crash with cmucl, but it does cause an error about
funcalling macro functions.

My guess is that the order in which the files have been compiled or

Found the problem.  When csimp2 is compiled, t//$ is defined yet (it's
in trigi).  Change that line from

       (cond (s (t//$ -3.141592654 (*$ a r ($sin (*$ 3.141592654 a))) 'gamma))

to

       (cond (s (//$ -3.141592654 (*$ a r ($sin (*$ 3.141592654 a)))))

and gamma(-0.2) returns the expected value.

Greetings, and thanks for your posted fix.  This has brought up an
issue I've been meaning to raise since the loss of our dear friend
Dr. Schelter. 

Is there any interest in forming a group to continue the development
and maintenance of maxima?  I for one would certainly be interested in
helping.  My qualifications are: Ph.D. in theoretical physics (and the
skills in mathematics pertaining thereunto :-)), fluent programming in
C, years of experience with Linux development tools, maintain Debian
maxima package.  Unfortunately, I currently have little ability in
Lisp, and am not very familiar with the maxima code base.

Anyone else interested?  It would seem that Lisp programmers and
experienced Maxima/Macsyma users would be in high demand.  If it would
be helpful, we might even avail ourselves of sourceforge.net, and
announce elsewhere.

Take care,

I am willing to help with maxima, but don't think I can give it the
time it needs.  I'd basically keep maxima running on cmucl and/or
clisp.  Perhaps some changes to various other parts when bugs are
encountered.  Currently, I was thinking of adding some more support
for elliptic functions and integrals.

But in any case, what better way to honor his memory than to keep
maxima (and gcl) well?

Agreed. I volunteer to help with testing.

If the people from UTexas need help with support of maxima lists
and/or Web site, I can participate too.

  I am familiar with lisp and with parts of the Macsyma source,
especially the parts I wrote. It would be nice to get the
Macsyma Inc source to update Maxima etc.  Some of the
people who worked on Macsyma Inc's system may be around
as well.  I don't know if they are on this list, but
I suspect not.
  There are probably 10-20 people.
They probably are gainfully employed doing other
things.

I agree the macsyma source code would be nice, but if
I recall correctly weren't there some problems with
that? My recollection is that the owner of Macsyma
sold it to someone who had not interest in opening the
source and apparently isn't even marketing it anymore.
 Has there been a breakthrough on that front?

Note that to a first approximation, mac421 is also running in GCL,

Message-ID: <20010919232707.7295.qmail@web12205.mail.yahoo.com>

One question I would like to bring up - since almost
none of us are familiar with the current maxima code
base, and few of us are qualified in Lisp, is there
any way we could "translate" maxima into another, more
widely used language? 

If this wouldn't be worthwhile then please forget I
mentioned it, but here are the points I've been
rolling around in my head which made me want to at
least pose the question:

1) C/C++ are in my experience widely taught and used
by schools, researchers, and other open source people,
while Lisp programming is a relatively rare skill. 
Since any open source project needs as many good
coders as possible, the odds are we would attract more
help if our language were a little more commonly used.
 

2) We might be able to convince people who are writing
routines for academic research projects or other high
end applications to write libraries which could be
added to maxima.  Since as far as I know (those who
know better feel free to correct me) most such
projects don't code in Lisp nowadays, the odds of our
being able to make use of those efforts is relatively
small, barring some ability of Lisp to interface with
other languages.

There are some obvious downsides as well, such as
moving from a working code base to basically creating
a new one and the potential difficulty of moving
concepts from Lisp to another language, but I thought
I would at least put the idea out there.

    Doesn't GNU emacs have Lisp built-in?  I think it's a
    different Lisp, but there should be some Lisp skilled people
    around given the popularity of emacs, no?

Regrettably, I don't have time to devote either.  Heck, I don't have time to
read this mailing list.  But maxima is a very useful tool, so I encourage folks
to follow up with this.  Clearly, the underlying algorithms are the most
important aspects of the tool.  However, a simple GUI front end with basic
on-line help would be a highly desirable addition.  This addition would make
this wonderful tool approachable by a much wider audience.

It seems there is a lot of interest, but a lot of people lack the
time.  I have the interest, and I could probably make a reasonable
amount of time, but alas I lack the skills.  My qualifications are a
Ph.D in math (and any skills in theoretical physics that entails), but
little programming experience.  (I've worked some in elisp, but I'm by
no means an expert.  I plan to familiarize myself with common lisp,
solely because of Maxima, but I'm not there yet.)
But to whoever continues the development, I can certainly help out
with things like documentation, and any busy work.

> ... we might even avail ourselves of sourceforge.net

I think that GNU has their own version of sourceforge (I don't
remember the name) that would probably be more appropriate.

To whoever said that the continued maintainance of Maxima would be a
good tribute to William Schelter, I wholeheartedly agree; I also think
that some form of Maxima needs to continue, and this seems to be the
only (or at least most visible) version remaining, and finally I think
that a free CAS is one of the more important free software projects.

Definitely. Unfortunately, Maxima is very alien to me. I have been
learning LISP just to work with Maxima, but unfortunately I'm still
very poor in it and even less with Maxima codebase.

For a few months I'll probably be quite busy--until I'll graduate
with MSc in information engineering.

Maybe there could be some central maintainer who would distribute
the list of things-to-do into Maxima mailing list? And then anybody
could reply, "I'll do it", who can do it.

I already made a patch to add GNU readline support and fixed some
problems with build (I think the problems exist with glibc2.06).
These were not accepted, but it's hard to me to improve those.

Every computer algebra system I know of has its own special purpose
high level language.  Most of the system consists of libraries, which
are usually most naturally written in that language.  For those
libraries it does not matter much which language has been used to
implement the core system including the CAS language.

That said, Maxima is richer than most systems because the underlying
language (common lisp) is still very well suited for symbolic
manipulation unlike C and C++.

> while Lisp programming is a relatively rare skill. 

In my opinion everybody with an interest in programming should learn
lisp if they don't know it already, which many do.

I saw one notice one the clisp mailing list.  I suspect that
volunteers would respond privately to him instead of in public.

If you want the message, I can dig it up.  It was just a sentence

But if there's enough people who can donate some time, good progress
can be made.  The maintainer(s) could just be people willing to accept
patches into the source with some testing.  We could depend on the
community to send bug reports and/or enhancements.  

And lisp isn't that hard to learn.  Even I could do it!  (But I
confess that the Lisp code in maxima looks quite a bit different from
the Lisp code I see nowadays.)

I'm a brazilian Doctorate student of Physics, I ported Maxima for Mac OS X

I'm also learning Cocoa and I think that having part of the code translated

Message-ID: <3BAA0A80.9040104@cs.berkeley.edu>

The willingness of people to contribute code in C or
other languages does not require rewriting Maxima in C.


I think that every implementation of common lisp has
a foreign function interface. This means that a
program written in non-lisp (typically C or C++ but
also Fortran or other languages with a similar
calling structure)  can be called.  So if you tell
me you have a superfast superwonderful program that
  you want to attach to maxima, it is possible and
usually trivial to make that call.  The biggest problem
is likely to be the data.  Easiest success is
usually sending an array of floats from lisp to c and
back.
Tougher problem is sending lisp lists etc from lisp
to c and back.  But what are you planning to do with
lisp lists in C that can't be done in lisp?

There is no standard for foreign function calls, but as
an example, I load the tiff (tagged image file format) library
into allegro common lisp by
(load "tifflib.dll")
  and I define corresponding lisp function like this...

(defforeign 'tiffopen :entry-point
   (convert-to-lang "TIFFOpen")
   :arguments '(string string)
   :return-type :integer)

There are similar but not identical routines in GCL, CMU lisp etc.

(It should be clear, however, that it is certainly
possible to do lisp list things in C.  GCL and probably every
other lisp does it all the time as part of the implementation
of Lisp.)

In fact from the perspective of Maxima, the value
of C is that it is a pretty good language in which to
implement Lisp.   But beyond that one should not use
C except for a very very good reason.  Improving performance
by 1% is not (in my thinking) a good reason, but people
can differ.

If you really want to write a bunch of C code to do
computer algebra, my suggestion is to read about and
duplicate the Maple kernel, which represents a stripped
down to the bare bones Lisp system with just enough data
types to implement Maple, and almost no waste.  Originally
they allowed only lists of max length 2^16. That was too
close to the bone and they had to rewrite their kernel to fix that.

Anyway, if you wrote the Maple kernel in a public way,
then Maxima could call it  {not as a separate process, but
as a subroutine} and use it to execute any program written
in Maple.  That way Maxima would swallow up any Maple
computational routine that was not under some kind of
intellectual license.  A much faster way of growing code.

Another possibility would be to write the Maple kernel
in Lisp.  This would actually be much easier, but the
result of simulating Maple data structures in Lisp would
slow it down somewhat.  The extra generality of Lisp
over Maple would cost something; I'm not sure how
much though. An interesting experiment.


A similar thing could be done with Mathematica. In fact
I have a big start on writing Mathematica in Lisp, available
from my web page.  www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman

Writing an alternative front end for Maxima is a tricky business.
Symmax or Schelter's Xmaxima  or ....
These are experiments in user interfaces, and regardless of
the programming skill of the implementor, can be good or bad
designs.  One possibility is to take an existing successful interface
and slavishly copy it.  There are several models.  Symmax, or
at least one version of it seemed to copy Mathcad.  I personally
don't care for that, but tastes vary. Mathematica, Maple, and the
commercial Macsyma are similar in many respects.

  I like the traditional script-based interaction, especially since
I can use emacs to manage the script. This is probably old-fashioned.
To the extent that the fancy interface makes this impossible,
I find myself uncomfortable. Even to the extent of managing a
script in emacs and then "batch" loading it into the computer
algebra system.

If you write a GUI, there are ways of doing so IN lisp,
but I think you have trouble with portability. See
  what Schelter did:  he used something like Tcl/TK which is
implemented on several platforms, and then linked to lisp
in another process.
This is not optimal on any specific platform, but it
is pretty good for portability.

PS. You could also look at other packages:  Matlab comes to
mind (or its free clone), could be added to Maxima.

nonlinear least-squares, wavelets, etc.  I'm a PhD astrophysicist.  BTW, I
did send a similar message earlier, but not to the whole list; my apologies.

    I could help with rpm packaging of maxima and gcl.  Unless

They are, and I think that may be one of the things to recommend that style of interface, if it can be managed - the less of a learning curve for people with previous training, the more willing they will be to look at Maxima.

I wouldn't say old-fashioned - I think that's a trait of true power users.  There are relatively few such users, but my guess is that they would all share that opinion.

What would you say are the ways current interfaces on other programs limit that type of work?  It would be nice to have our cake and eat it too, so to speak.

Is that how xemacs does it's GUI?  I must confess I didn't have much luck trying to figure out the Lisp GUI game.

Is that ability specific to Tcl/Tk or can that be done with other toolkits?

Given how fast most modern computers are, I suspect we can afford to give up a little efficiency in the communication between the front and back end, as long as the result isn't visible to the user.

As to portability, I like the looks of the WxWindows toolkit - it has Linux and Windows versions and I believe there is even a port to the Mac underway. Unfortunately, I believe it is a C++ library - does that squash the chances of maxima talking to it?

I think that's Octave?  I've often wondered if a merger of that project and Maxima would be a good idea - they seem to have done well with the numerical end of things.

As to the documentation, I believe all we have right
now are a few examples, man pages and a manual
describing the functions.  A more friendly, complete
manual (using docbook maybe?) would be of considerable
help, but would also be a lot of work.  Any thoughts?

Sure, but since it's a GNU project, it should probably be hosted on 
Savannah (http://savannah.gnu.org/).

Before we do this, look at other peoples' opinions.  There was some
discussion on the CMUCL mailing lists about moving CMUCL to
sourceforge when the CMUCL server disappeared.  I think the XEmacs
guys also looked into this.

The general conclusion was that sourceforge was not that good. I'd
point you to the mailing list archives, but they're not available
yet. :-(  If we have local support at UT, that might be best.  It
shouldn't be a problem giving CVS commit access to the necessary
people.

But sourceforge seems to work well for others, so, who knows?

Does anyone know anything about ECLS?
(http://ecls.sourceforge.net)  It is yet another lisp
implimentation, but this part of it's description
sounds interesting:

"ECLS (ECL for short) uses standard C calling
conventions for Lisp compiled functions, which allows
C programs to easily call Lisp functions and
viceversa. No foreign function interface is required:
data can be exchanged between C and Lisp with no need
for conversion."

Would that characteristic be of any use to us in the
C/Lisp issue?

Obviously whatever everyone decides. Maybe for the
main development something like savannah would make
more sense. The reason I like sourceforge it that (at
least up til now) it has always  been a good reliable
place to have code hosted.

In any case, even if we don't do the main development
there, it seems a shame to waste the site.  Maybe it
could at least be a mirror for releases and the
website?  According to it's web logs it gets a small
number of hits every few days, probably from people
looking for the maxima stuff.  As of now there is
nothing there. Maybe we could say that development is
taking place elsewhere, and only stable releases are
put on the sourceforge site?

    My experience with GNU is even better than SourceForge, but
    GNU's site could use a little more modern navigation system,

Oops, my bad.
Maxima is listed on the GNU software page under non-GNU software.
It used to be listed under GNU software.
What happened?
And why is RMS looking for a new maintainer if it isn't GNU?
(gcl is still GNU, though.)

I suspect that Lisp savvy developers already know about Maxima.  If
they're not here already, SourceForge won't help.

What constituents being a "GNU project"?  Clisp is released under the
GPL.  Is it a "GNU project"?   It's hosted on sourceforge.

    Jay> Oops, my bad.
    Jay> Maxima is listed on the GNU software page under non-GNU software.
    Jay> It used to be listed under GNU software.

Probably out of date.  It wasn't GNU probably because of licensing
issues, which have been resolved in the last few months.  Maxima is
legally available under a GPL license, thanks to Bill Schelter for
getting the DOE's official ok.

    There is a precident for distributing releases through
    SourceForge but keeping the development elsewhere.  But not
    too many projects actually do that.

I think being a GNU project has more to do with who
has the copyright.  GPL, obviously, but the FSF has to
be able to defend it as well.
 
I know that the GPL release of Maxima is subject to
some export restrictions or something like that - how
does the FSF feel about that kind of stuff?

Really?  Didn't know that.  Why is that?  Is it because the code came
from the DOE?

There is matlisp (on sourceforge) that hooks LAPACK into lisp with
some matrix classes through in.  Only works with CMUCL and ACL
currently.  It should work with any Lisp that an FFI and stores
double-float arrays in exactly the same way Fortran would store them.

I've always thought that would be cool to put the two together.
Perhaps this is what the SENAC (?) guys in New Zealand did (with
different packages)?

Is it because maxima is slow in generating the data for plotting or is
it because the display of the plot is slow?  The Klein bottle demo is
pretty slow on my 300 MHz Ultra 30.  Rotating the plot with the mouse
is pretty fast, but the surface is very randomly patched until I stop
moving the mouse.  Then the display is fixed very quickly.  On my 800
MHz Linux box, I think the surface rotates nicely in one piece.

I think maxima has the right idea:  Use some external process to do
the actual display and let maxima generate the data.  Doing anything
else makes maxima much less portable.

They are, and I think that may be one of the things to
recommend that style of interface, if it can be
managed - the less of a learning curve for people with
previous training, the more willing they will be to
look at Maxima.

I wouldn't say old-fashioned - I think that's a trait
of true power users.  There are relatively few such
users, but my guess is that they would all share that
opinion.

 What would you say are the ways current interfaces on
other programs limit that type of work?  It would be
nice to have our cake and eat it too, so to speak.

Is  that how xemacs does it's GUI?  I must confess I
didn't have much luck trying to figure out the Lisp
GUI game.

Is that ability specific to Tcl/Tk or can that be done

Given how fast most modern computers are, I suspect we
can afford to give up a little efficiency in the
communication between the front and back end, as long
as the result isn't visible to the user.As to
portability, I like the looks of the WxWindows toolkit
- it has Linux and Windows versions and I believe
there is even a port to the Mac underway.
Unfortunately, I believe it is a C++ library - does
that squash the chances of maxima talking to it?

I think that's Octave?  I've often wondered if a
merger of that project and Maxima would be a good idea
- they seem to have done well with the numerical end
of things.

Also, does anyone know anything about the plplot
library?  In my experience, at least, the current
plotting routine seems a bit slow under Linux (it does
OK on Windows) and plplot seems to handle a lot of the
same types of operations.

Yes.  If you read the original DOE letter it mentions
that, and there is also a file in the maxima tarballs
that gives the details on that.

That's the behavior I see.  Is there any way to make
that cleaner?  The current plotting isn't bad, but I
think smoother graphics (maybe with Macsyma style
controls) would probably turn some heads.

Agreed.  The trick is talking between the two.

1. How about if we change the subject to
reflect the topic, instead of using tired old
thread names.

2. The Macsyma source code circa 1982 is not
covered by the Gnu public license.  It is at
this point FREE software.  Byt contrast, the Gnu software
is RESTRICTED by the Gnu public license.  What
does it mean for the code to be free? and
why is GPL restricted?

Someone could take Macsyma, polish it up, make it
better (or worse) and sell it, license it,
make money on it, and not distribute the revised
source.  This might be attractive to some
entrepreneur, and useful to some body of users
who would like to pay for support, and not have
to worry about source code etc.  The downside
of GPL is that such an entrepreneur would be
discouraged if Macsyma code were GPL'd. 

I do not know the status of Bill Schelter's add-on
code and GPL.  I do not release my code under GPL;
if I think about it I label it with my name and/or
my institution as copyright owner. And then I
give it away.

Please, let's not do this. Why does it matter if the language is
widely used? Should we use VB? I hope not! I think that lisp is a
perfect tool for the job.

Lisp skill is not that rare a skill; and you will in all likelihood
find more good programmers in the lisp community than among the C/C++
coders coming out from school.

If there are libraries we want to put to use in maxima (LAPACK comes
to my mind e.g.) that are not written in lisp, we can use the ffi of
the underlying lisp to interface to the code. (I'm not an expert on
gcl, but any other lisp I know - CMU CL, clisp, Allegro, Lispworks -
has a good ffi. So that is not a problem).

What I would welcome is a move to make maxima easier to install on
other lisps, not only on gcl. That would have a lot more benefit to it
than a move away from lisp to some other language.

Is that really true?  If so, then why did Bill Schelter need to get
that letter from the DOE?  There must have been at least some
confusion on the true legal status of that code.

Use something else beside tcl/tk for omplotdata?

Use the same protocol, whatever that is.  I'm pretty sure maxima just
starts up a pipe to the other process and just sends data down the
pipe.

No, no, no. It's only those countries USA doesn't like, Iraq, Afghanistan
and so on. Not Germany, I believe :)

Besides, even if export to Germany would be prohibited, it wouldn't
stop you using it in the Germany after _someone_ has exported it.
(If this is at all similar to the crypto export restrictions).

Read the license documents that came with your Maxima.

I think he really didn't _need_ it, but more it was just a formal
affirmation, that makes one feel safer using the code.

What comes to the DOE export restrictions, to me it looks quite
much like it is GPL incompatible. That is, Maxima really isn't GPL'ed
after all, althought quite close--but unfortunately GPL incompatible,
so you can't incorporate GPL code into Maxima codebase, if you want
to go strictly legal way. To me it doesn't matter tough...

Mr. Fateman said that since GPL makes commercial usage more difficult,
it really isn't a free software. Opinions differ, but I think that
the only way to ensure that the code is as free as possible and
also _keeps_ being free, is the GPL. A BSD licensed software might
be more free at some moment, but after it is commercialized
it probably won't be anymore free. Yes, the original code stays
still free but newer versions won't as they would with GPL.

Unfortunately, especially in light of the WTC, they
are likely to be much tougher about this one on the
hill now.  Also, if we want to use any other code
rather than writing it all ourselves, it may be a
significant issue.  If we don't, then it doesn't
matter particularly - we just have to stop saying the
software is under GPL.  Richard's code certainly
isn't, as he made clear.  The thing is, there must be
some basis for the response Bill got when he talked to
the government folks.  Was the original funding that
allowed the creation of Macsyma under DOE control, and
thus any code funded by that money was subject to
those restrictions?

Here's the relevant part:

"Distribution of this derivative work is subject to
the US Export Administration Regulations (Title 15 CFR
768-799), which implements the Export Administration

But still free, in some opinions, and designed to stay that way.

That was done, right?  And the result is that, except for the copies
that are already out there, Macsyma is unavailable.  Any improvements
specific to that version are currently lost.

The GPL ensures that what happened to Macsyma won't happen to Maxima.
That makes me happy.

According to the README in the tar file, the code there is GPLed, that
would include the add-on code.  I don't know of any mention of
dual-licensing.

Maxima is GPLed.  Unfortunately I don't recall where I read it, but I
seem to recall reading a discussion of this topic, the conclusion was
that licensing is independent of export regulations.

At least for William Schelter's modifications, we can't do that.
I don't think we want to get rid of his modifications, there is no
need to fork Maxima.

> Richard's code certainly isn't, as he made clear.

He said he didn't put it under GPL, but he indicated that he wanted
people to do with it as they will.  He may want to clarify that, but
William Schelter certainly thought that Richard Fateman gave him
permission to include some of his (Richard's) code in the GPLed Maxima
(which of course doesn't mean that Richard's code was GPLed at all).
Look at the top of mactex.lisp in the src directory.

Since the DOE gave permission to William Schelter to relicense it,
they must have held the copyright.  The original authors don't always
have the copyright.

I can clarify this point.  I think I may have started this...

Back in the 90's I was considering distributing Maxima commercially,
as a low-cost free-software alternative to the proprietary systems.

At that time the source code was on the GNU CDROM with no indication
of the license.  So I had some concerns about potentially infringing
on the rights of Macsyma Inc, DOE or others.

I wrote a letter to the FSF asking if they could get a written
statement of the license -- to minimise my potential liability.

Of course, this took a long time and I moved on to other projects.
Another person followed up on it, doing more work than me to chase it
up, and eventually this resulted in the letter from DOE.

Brian Gough

If you are looking for volunteers in order to keep Maxima (and I'm a 
potential volunteer), it would be nice if you could provide documentation:
some kind of Tutorial explaining source extracts and the project itself,
also links for Lisp.

In my opinion, that's what every open source project should do in order to
transform users into developers.

Also, an html document (or something else) as a "Maxima's Reference guide"
briefly describing each command containing the topics: "usage", "examples"
and "description" would be extremely valuable. This would be easily added
to the GUI in a "Topic Seach".

Ijust looked at the letter. It doesn't reflect the
history......  back in 1968-1980
MIT was funded by DOE and others. DOE had a library facility
called NESC (National Energy Software Center) that distributed
code produced under DOE sponsorship. MIT did not want the
code distributed at all. Under pressure from me, and later
Bill, they relented.  The principal reason for the code to
be broken free, informally distributed by wfs was, I think, that
NESC lost its funding, and if it had any interest in enforcement,
it was unfunded.

If you think Macsyma is an armament, I guess you
might need a license. ETSC is not saying you need a
license, just that you might.  Note that WFS was
given permission world-wide...

Typically MIT may claim copyright; certain rights were
sold to Macsyma Inc. 
Some pieces are marked as copyright UC Berkeley, I think.
And I think Bill Schelter copyrighted all the changes
he made. Probably most of the people who wrote code
do not have any apparent claim.  Many of  them are
entirely unmentioned, though some are castigated in
the comments  ...e.g. ;; I can't believe XXX did it this way...
etc.

I really doubt that.  
Ask a lawyer if it is ok to do something, and the
lawyer will likely look for the way to cover his/her ass.
In this case, it would be "don't allow anyone to do anything".

I think GTK+ starting at like version 1.2.8 would be a good substitued 
because more platformave have GTK+ than current versions of Tcl/Tk and
would probably be more stable and perform better.

Anyone who wants to start developing a GTK+ interface might find this
useful: <URL:http://sourceforge.net/projects/clg>.

On the other hand the user interface could be written in some entirely
different programming language and it could just run Maxima as a
subprocess, like Symaxx does.

Like on C++,we shoud be able to control name space with context mechanism on MAXIMA.

But that is too complex to use for beginner.
For example,(C10) functions;

(D10) [EV_DIFF(X),.........,TRIGSIMP(EXPN),......]
(C11) fundef(trigsimp);
 			                  			 TRIGSIMP1(NUM(EXPN))
(D11) TRIGSIMP(EXPN) := RATSIMP(----------------------)
							TRIGSIMP1(DENOM(EXPN))
we know at this point,global MACSYMA function TRIGSIMP is redefined.
(C12) load(trgsmp);
(C13) fundef(trigsimp);

(D13) TRIGSIMP(X) := TRIGSIMP3(RADCAN(APPLY1(X, TRIGRULE1, TRIGRULE2, 

	TRIGRULE3, TRIGRULE4, HTRIGRULE1, HTRIGRULE2, HTRIGRULE3, HTRIGRULE4)))

maybe this definition is  original.
overwrite is  dangerous until you grow accustom to use maxima.

in particular. Unfortunately not with Maxima/Macsyma/Common LISP
but mostly with Reduce and Standard LISP. Now I plan to
port on Maxima my program for computation in differential
geometry and gravity theory. I think that it is good way
to master Maxima and background LISP system.
I also plan to maintain binary Maxima/GCL packages for
ALT Linux - Mandrake derived Russian distributive.

Dear Maxima's Users,

Could you please advice how to link up bookmode.el to emacs or xemacs?
I copied this file in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp, but  it does not help.
Another problem is, after linking  maxima-mode.el up to emacs there is a nice maxima tool
box in emacs's menu. However such a thing does not exist when I switch to maxima-mode in
xemacs, though the functionality of maxima-mode through command line is the same as in
emacs.

best regards,

Valerij

Subject: [Maxima] RE: future of Maxima
Message-ID: <3BAEF1DA.911DDD92@natlab.research.philips.com>

Hello list,

I just wanted to add a few remarks:

1. About reimplementing Maxima in another language.

This will be extremely difficult, since Maxima uses quite
a lot of special features of Lisp. In particular, it uses
the Lisp lists and symbols, it uses the bignum and
rational number support from Lisp, and it uses the
introspection facilities in Lisp. The latter makes
things possible such as simple defining a function $foobar
on the Lisp level and then having it immediately available
as foobar() in Maxima. Try that in C++...

And of course, it is all untyped.

Having that said, I think the code base in Maxima could stand
a cleanup. For starters, the code is mostly in UPPER CASE,
although that is easy to fix. I also saw quite a number
of occurences of (go ...) (Lisp's goto construct). More
in general, the code is often difficult to read and could
use more commenting. The code is not very consistent:
that much already shows by seeing file extensions such as .lisp,
.lsp and even .LISP all used.

Another problem is all the special support for things like 
Multics and the old Lisp machine. I don't see how we could
possibly hope to keep all this in sync with new additions.
Perhaps a policy should be developed on which platforms are
officially supported, and what is done with code for non-supported
platforms (retained as-is? updated to track the rest of the source,
even if it cannot be tested? simply removed?)

2. About GUI support

The current xmaxima talks over a pipe to the real maxima. 
Doing the GUI
directly from Lisp would be more elegant; unfortunately, there
is no such thing as a standard GUI interface for Lisp. 
So I think that the pipe idea is still the best idea:

1. The Lisp code remains portable
2. Emacs people can still use it
3. The GUI can be implemented in an arbitrary programming language.

Note that Mathematica also has the kernel in a separate process,
so this is apparently not an impediment for popularity.

One problem is that one might want nicely typeset output
(i.e. two-dimensional formulas, and not in ASCII art as
the current maxima does, but with real intergral signs.)

This could be implemented by adding a new output format to Maxima.
Using this output format, Maxima would 
1. output formulas in 1D, and
2. add control sequences that indicate 2D layout and special
   symbols such as integral signs and arrows.

Every front end could then typeset the output it received from
Maxima over the pipe in a manner suitable for its intended
audience. In this way, one could have both an Emacs front-end and
a C++ GUI front-end talking to the same Maxima kernel.

Just some ideas.

Greetings,

Stephan

I just want to note that each Lisp system has compiler
which actually does such a translation. Sometimes to C,
sometimes to Assembler, sometimes to some special
bytecode depending on concrete Lisp implementation.

Besides IMHO Lisp based computer algebra systems
are more flexible than ones written in say C or other
similar procedure language. If  you write your package
for Reduce or Maxima (Lisp) you can easily use
low level features. Nothing like this is possible
in Mathematica or Maple (C).

So let Maxima remains Maxima.

In fact such front-end to Maxima already exists. This is maxima mode
in TeXmacs. It is a bit slow and maybe it is not optimal solution but it
works. There is also similar front-end <=> kernel GUI implementation
in Reduce.

You could probably just load maxima-mode.el and/or bookmode.el
directly in your startup .emacs or (.xemacs/xemacs) file.  Or just do
it manually via M-x load-file.

After loading "vect",  you may remove commutivity from "." with the command

(c1) remove(".", commutative);

In Maxima and Macsyma, atoms can be declared to be nonscalar, but there is
no way
to distinguish "simple vectors" (vectors with scalar components) from
matrices;
computations involving  atoms that are matrices (where "." isn't
commutative) and
simple vectors (where "." is commutative) isn't supported.    I've written
parts of a new vector
package that declares a  feature "vector" that allows symbolic computations
involving matrices and vectors. (I've forgotten the details, but Maxima's
vect package
doesn't always simplify  terms involving the cross and dot products that
should vanish
to zero).  Someday, I'll finish my code, but don't hold your breath.
Additionally, under
Maxima, the crossproduct misbehaves for vectors that aren't simple (it uses
"*" for
the product).

Macsyma Inc Macsyma's vect package had (or has) a  option variable
simple_vector_p that if true made Macsyma assume that each component of a
vector was scalar; maxima doesn't have this option.

That's nice, since XEmacs is already available for Mac OS X.

But I'd like to implement Maxima using Cocoa:

For Mac OS X (or Darwin), as far as I know there's no Tcl/Tk implementation.
It's true that I could use Cocoa to wrap a Maxima session under my own
designed GUI, but features like plotting in Cocoa uses NSBezierPath and
specific methods (kind of C functions) etc. So, it would be desirable if I
could understand the code itself.

My knowledge of LISP is ZERO and it would be great if you could give me an
overview of the code and point me to some links.

Notice that the dislay of 2D formulas and palettes could be implemented
quite easily. Also, an integrated Help using the "Help Center".

Thanks in advance,

I just thought I'd float it out there and see. 
Obviously there are sufficient good reasons not to.

That cleanup would be an extremely good idea, and IMHO
would probably be good to make the first priority, to
keep things organized - writing new code is easier if
what's already there is standard, clean and commented.

Are there still any of those machines in actual use? 
We may not have to worry about that at all, and if we
don't maybe we can clean up the code further by
removing those parts.

OK, here's my reasoning - older versions won't vanish,
and will still have this support.  We should not
update code we can't test - the minute we do that
someone will use it to do something important and a
zillion bugs will fall out.  Also, if no one is using
those parts, why waste the effort?  We can just say
version X is the last version which supports platform
Y.  My feeling is that the best thing would probably
be to remove it in new versions, in the interests of a
clean, smooth system, but as I said that's only IMHO
and those who know better should be the ones listened
to.

I agree.  I have a glade interface template at
http://mathshield.sourceforge.net with a few of the
basics, and there is a group in Italy working on a
widget which may be of considerable help to us in the
graphical display of equations but things like
plotting would still have to be handled somehow.

As I mentioned earlier, there is a project at
http://cs.unibo.it/~lpadovan/mml-widget/ which might
be able to help us in that department.  It doesn't
have editing capabilities yet, but I believe that
support is planned.

Actually, what I had hoped to do was use the mml
widget above and teach maxima to output mathml - Dr.
Barton Willis
http://www.unk.edu/acad/math/people/willisb/ has
already done some work along those lines and was kind
enough to send me his code.  He doesn't use the
version intended for browsers and the like to display,
but that shouldn't be too hard to add (famous last
words)

That's almost certainly the best way to handle it. 
That way, Richard can have an interface which works
for him on the scripting/power usage, and we wimps can
have our GUI. We may want to come up with our own
communication syntax, or maybe use mathml/TeX/whatever
(thanks to Richard maxima can already do TeX output). 
Or maybe even be flexible enough to let the front end
specify ASCII, TeX, or MathML.  That would probably be
the most powerful setup.  Heck, if mozilla really does
include mathml support and abiword starts using it for
their stuff, we might be able to do some really wild
and crazy interfacing.

Hm, putting
(autoload 'book-mode "bookmode" "" t)
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.bk" . book-mode) auto-mode-alist))
in your .emacs file should work, but doesn't for me right now.
Putting 
(load "bookmode")
in your .emacs file will work, though.

Well, emacs and xemacs handle menus differently, so menus for xemacs
just weren't put in.  That'd be easy enough to fix. 
(Hm.  The maxima-mode.el that comes with maxima-5.6 doesn't have menu
support put in for GNU emacs, either.)

Message-ID: <4nwv2owl0t.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

While learning and playing around with elliptic functions and
integrals, I'm getting tired of manually looking up the rules for
differentiation and integration of elliptic functions.

Can someone tell me how to get maxima to understand this?

For example

diff(sn(u),u) = cn(u)*dn(u),
diff(cn(u),u) = -sn(u)*dn(u),

etc.

Also, how can I get maxima to recognize the 12 basic elliptic
integrals.  That is, can I get maxima to see

integrate(1/sqrt((a^2-t^2)*(b^2-t^2)),t,0,x)

is an elliptic integral whose value is

1/s*asn(x/b|b^2/a^2)?

where asn is the inverse sn function?

If things go well, I'd like to add some support for elliptic functions
to maxima.

Thanks,

Ray


P.S.  maxima understands sn and friends but only accepts numeric
arguments.  If you give it symbolic args, it produces some random
floating-point answer.   I'll need to change this.

I don't have as much experience as you do, but I like the way Mathematica 
handles with the input/output. The input can be a 2D equation and the output
always is a 2D equation. So, you can simply C-c the, let's say, denominator
of a given output and expand or simplify it. Then you can C-c just a parcel
of the same output and collect it. Later you can combine the results in a
single input and integrate over some variable. That saves a lot of time.

If it were me to implement that, I would create a translator 2D
equation-to-1D equation and another 1D-to-2D translator. So, it would be
nice if I could have a Maxima session receiving and sending just 1D
equations. This session would be wrapped in a display containing just 2D
equations.

In addition, outputs could be pasted to a buffer, and those equation could
be enumerated. Fonts could be changed and text added. Graphics could be
pasted too. In Cocoa, such buffer could be saved as RTFD, PS and PDF files
almost effortless and such document would be ready for submission. Yet, an
RTFD-to-LaTeX translator would be necessary.

Anyway,

Undoubtedly true.  Much code was written in Maclisp,

If it isn't broken, be careful about fixing it.
ANSI common lisp does not distinguish between the
symbols FOO and foo.

Removing go's in favor of something else is undoubtedly
a bad idea. If it isn't broken don't fix it.

Lots of people wrote parts of the code.  Some of the
code was actually "improved" by people who were IMHO
overconfident that they knew "the right way"  but
were sadly mistaken. They introduced many layers of
macro expansion, some of which you now see producing
bugs.

Cleaning up the file-name extensions seems OK, but
I think the fixups should be of the form "here is the
newly implemented/tested/improved  X module".  Not
"I fiddled around with this working code so I could
understand it, and took out whatever I didn't understand,
and I hope it still works for you... it seems ok
in my limited tests." :)

I assume that no effort will go into maintaining such
compatibility, but such code is clearly marked by notations
such as #+Multics (....)

This would not affect much computational code.  It would

Such code is typically compiled away into nothing on
other platforms.  Deleting it makes the source
code slightly smaller;  the vast majority of such
conditionalizations are in macro files that should
not be touched except by people who know all about
all places those macros are used.  (i.e. by no one).

I suspect that MathML rendering is a solution to a different
problem. 
 The real issue between front and back end is transmitted
messages like "stop what you are doing"   and "are you still alive".
Anything else can be character strings, which is I think
what the front and back end of Mathematica talk to each
other.
MathML has very limited appeal to me.  It is also about 100X more
verbose than necessary.   (or as a friend of mine says,
"it compresses very well").
On the other hand, producing MathML would be easy. Just
take (for example) the MacTeX generator and modify the
format for output   MathML instead of TeX.

Message-ID: <200109242032.f8OKW1u03387@convair.dt.navy.mil>


Maxima 5.6/gcc 2.4.0, this  says it all:

(C1) a:cosh(x);
(D1)                                COSH(x)
(C2) tex(a);
$$COSH\left(x\right)$$

(C3) b:cosh(x)^2;
                                       2
(D3)                               COSH (x)
(C4) tex(b);
$$%COSH^{2}x$$
(D4)                                 FALSE


Obviously the "%" in the texification of cosh^2 is wreaking havoc with
my doc ... I assume it should be \cosh in Tex as it is in Latex (but
am not a Tex user per se). Am I safe to just do something like sed
's/%/\\/', or should I be more concerned than that?

Note that dn, cn, etc are used by maxima's ellipt
package. Unfortunately it is used for numerical calclation only. So
let us defne sn1, dn1, etc. Then you can say:

(C12) gradef(sn1(u),cn1(u)*dn1(u));

(D12)				    sn1(u)
(C13) diff(sn1(x),x);

(D13)				 cn1(x) dn1(x)

Thanks.  I noticed that and I've changed that in my copy of maxima.
(Renamed them them from <> to fp_<>, for floating-point version).

This works.  Now, how do I get it to recognize that sn(0,m) = 0,
cn(0,m) = 1, etc.?  With the gradef stuff above, I get this:

taylor(sn(u,m),u,0,2)

I get stuff involving sn(0,m), cn(0,m), etc., that should be
simplified out.

I tried copying what maxima does with %sin, but this doesn't cause
simplication to happen.

Subject: [Maxima] A few modest proposals for maxima maintinability
Message-ID: <3BAFF3E6.F0CA09BD@fnal.gov>

There has been quite a bit of discussion here about future directions
for Maxima. The maintainability of the existing code should be the very
first concern. I have a set of modest proposals to enhance the
maintainability of the code base:

0) I would like to see the code base focus on ANSI CL first, existing
Lisp implementations second. 

1) Port the build system to mk:defsystem from the Common Lisp Open Code
Collection (CLOCC, see <http://clocc.sourceforge.net>.) Right now the
build process for GCL is totally different for than that for CLISP and
CMUCL. I don't think anyone can build Maxima under anything but GCL
right now without looking under the covers.

2) Greatly reduce the number of conditionals (i.e., #+Multics) in the
code. Use the "port" package from CLOCC whenever possible. Remove
support for PDP10, Multics, etc.

3) Reformat the code to consistent case and indentation conventions,
without changing any of the logic. Perform the case and indentation
stages in separate steps committed to CVS.

4) Adopt a common suffix for lisp files.

Obviously, my thoughts are similar to Stephan Houben's. I would like to
emphasize, however, that I would not change *any* logic in any existing
code at this point. Richard Fateman has repeatedly admonished us not to
fix that which is not broken. Unfortunately, insofar as the code needs
to be comprehended by a human, it is broken. I believe these steps would
make Maxima considerably more comprehensible.

Best,
Jim

I made one. It works fine, but hasn't been accepted into the Maxima
distribution, maybe because it's a bit ugly at certain points.

Unfortunately I don't have it here just now but I'll bring it for
tomorrow.

Actually it is patch against GCL that brings readline support
for all Lisp programs.

It also does not work for me.
Ok, actually this is not a big problem. I can use the maxima and octave modes

Looking at mactex.lisp, it appears to be not a bug but just an
incomplete setup list. Here's a patch that "seems to" work, haven't
tested it thoroughly.  Maybe this list should be expanded to include
things that aren't "log-like" in Latex but have names in Maxima, e.g.

(%atanh "\\tanh^{-1}")   (or maybe "\\mbox{\\rm atanh}")

and so forth.

thanks again,

P.S. this sure beats the customer support I used to get with Brand X!

Isn't already pretty close?  CMUCL and Clisp are pretty close to ansi
and maxima works with them.  There are some issues on debugging though
because the code uses evalhook which is CLtL1.  CMUCL doesn't have
this.

But for CMUCL all you have to do is read the comments at the beginning
of compile-cmulisp.lisp and you know how to build it.  The same
approach works for Clisp.

I disagree with 2) and 3).  It's way to easy when doing these things
to say "Hey, this is ugly.  Let me just tweak it like so."  And
suddenly some weird case breaks and no one knows where now because
EVERY single line has been touched.  It ain't broke so don't fix it.
However, I have no problems if something is broken and you fix it and
reindent and change case too.

Although I find the code written in a unique style, I can read and
understand some of it.  Internals and stuff are beyond me right now
though.

Thanks1  That works.  However, what if I want sn1(.5, .8) to give me
some number?  I don't know how to do that.

Allegro CL is ANSI, and I had a build routine for Maxima 5.2. It was
probably not quite as successful as GCL, and it certainly did not do
the fancy front end.  I think that it does not take much effort to
bring it up to latest Maxima. Yet there may be pieces that fail to work
with mk:defsystem.

And for ACL, there is another file, I think.  Probably I sent one in
a while ago.

My suggestion is that if something is broken
that either the minimal patch be found,

or if someone is ambitious,

the interfaces to major routines be thoroughly documented and
a whole "file sized" replacement be considered.  The major routines
are those used from outside that file, and typically will be
only a few in each file.

Just a thought...
You may find that the best documentation for some features is
exactly the stuff you want to remove.  That is, the multics or pdp10
code which has the same functionality but in a different lisp may
actually explain what the CL is trying to do!

I don't know how to compile GCL on IRIX 6.5 (Indigo2, so using n32), but
clisp-2.26 works and has readline functionality.  I got this going
by cribbing from my previous Irix 5.3 installation of maxima with
clisp, so I'm not sure if you can bootstrap clisp without a working
interpreter.

Maxima 5.6 can be built using clisp, following hints posted to this
list for MacOS-X, but many things are broken.  I did get xmaxima to
run, using the following rather ugly hacks:

1.  get the latest CVS version of xmaxima and make sure you it
    won't run 'kill -1':

    proc CMkill { signal pid } {
      global ws_openMath 2.
      puts "CMkill: pid=$pid"
      if { $pid != -1 } {
        if { [info command "winkill"] == "winkill" } {
           winkill -pid $pid -signal $signal
        } else {
          exec $ws_openMath(kill) $signal $pid
        }
      }
    }

2.  maxima on clisp lacks :lisp() so you have to use to_lisp:

   x-clisp {set ws_openMath(localMaximaServer) "clisp -M \
            [file join $ws_openMath(maximaPath) src/maxima-clisp.mem] \
            -i [file join $ws_openMath(maximaPath)  src/server.lisp] \
            -x \"to_lisp();  (progn (user::setup PORT)(values))\" &"
           }

3. add a "(run): to src/server.lisp to get back to maxima:

    #+clisp (run) ;; return to maxima

This is almost useful.  For example, 2D plots work, but 3D plots fail with
the error:

*** - FUNCALL: the function POLYGON-PTS is undefined

On my SGI system maxima has readline-style line editing/history.  I
assume this is inherited from clisp.

You are correctly representing the Maxima status quo. I am proposing a
modest change to the priorities for the future of Maxima. The situation
to date is this: Maxima works well with GCL. It mostly works with CLisp
and CMUCL if you do things like read the comments in some lisp files and
ignore functions which rely on non-ANSI code. I would like to change
priorities so that working well with ANSI code comes first, not last. I
would also like to change the build system so that switching between
lisp implementations is more transparent than it is now. I think Maxima
will be better off in the future if it is not tied as closely to the
highly idiosyncratic GCL as it is right now.

Best,
Jim

Message-ID: <01092600553300.01245@localhost.localdomain>

Dear Maxima's Users,

Sometimes ago  I revealed it but did not ask. Why the itensor package 
disappear from maxima-5.6, though one was existed in maxima-5.4. 
Some changes in another package ctensr was made. Perhaps this results to the 
following: 
(C1) load(ctensr);
(D1) 				 ./ctensr.mac
(C2) load("ctenso.dm1");
Could not find `max$disk:[tensor]CTENSR.mc' using paths in 

FILE_SEARCH_MAXIMA,FILE_SEARCH_LISP (combined values: 

[./###.{mc,mac}, /usr/lib/maxima-5.6/{mac,sym}/###.mac, 

/usr/lib/maxima-5.6/{share,share1,share2,tensor}/###.mc, ./###.{o,lsp,lisp}, 

/usr/lib/maxima-5.6/{src,share1,sym}/###.o, 

/usr/lib/maxima-5.6/{src,share1,sym}/###.o, 

/usr/lib/maxima-5.6/{src,share}/###.lisp, /usr/lib/maxima-5.6/{sym}/###.lsp] )
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)
(Well, I tried to correct "ctenso.dm1" by commenting the string where the 
CTENSR.mc is called and this gives:
(C3) load("ctenso.dm1");
Evaluation took 00.10 seconds (00.40 elapsed)
(D3) 				  ctenso.dm1
(C4) 
without any information about what was it done. The same result is with 
others ctensr.dm#
What is going wrong?

One idea about the future of maxima. It would be extremely usefull to make an 
electronic archive about applications of maxima in science. As for me, I'm 
working in turbulence astrophysics and having expirience in calculations 
typical for turbulence physics (it concerns moslty with averaging operations 
of tensors) I'm going to adopt my codes from mathematica to maxima in near 
future. 

best regards, Valerij

Easy. This will substitute sn1 by the original sn iff both arguments
are numerical:

(C46) matchdeclare(x,numberp);

(D46)				     DONE
(C47) matchdeclare(y,numberp);

(D47)				     DONE
(C48) tellsimp(sn1(x,y),sn(x,y));

(D48)			       [sn1RULE1, FALSE]
(C49) sn1(0.8,0.5);

(D49)			       0.69093485086644
(C50) sn1(0.8,x);

(D50)				  sn1(0.8, x)
(C51) 

Note, that I use sn for the original float-point function. Since you
redefined it, you probably need to use fp_sn here.

Also, if you want your own rules to apply before numerical evaluation,
you might want to use tellsimpafter instead of tellsimp in (c48)
above.

[solution snipped]

Very nice.  Your help is very much appreciated.

I now have a final question.  sn has these properties:

sn(u/2)^2 = (1-cn(u))/(1+dn(u))

sn(2*u) = 2*sn(u)*cn(u)*dn(u)/(1-m*sn(u)^4)

How do I get maxima to understand this?  However, I don't want this
applied all of the time, just like the corresponding trig functions.

Thanks!

Ray

You haven't said what you want done.  identities
go both ways.  if you want to substitute
(1-cn(u)/(1+dn(u)) for sn(u/2)^2 then try

ratsubst(..., sn(u/2)^2,  expression).


Also, for specific u or "any" u?

You could look at the code for trigsimp.

Also, for sin/cos/tan etc  there are complex exponentials
which provide a clue to canonical forms. Exponentialize
does this..

  Maybe there
is something similar for sn cn etc.

"Any" u.  I was just wondering if such a thing could be done without
going into Lisp and the guts of maxima.  But perhaps the best thing
would be some functions analogous to trigexpand and trigreduce to
handle these.

I guess that would be the Jacobi theta functions, but I'm just
learning about these and playing around for fun.  There's no
application or anything "real" behind my questions.  

Elliptic functions have a very pretty theory and I always wanted to
know what the actual period of a simple pendulum is without using the
small angle approximation.

Currently, maxima says

(C21) solve(x^4+1=0,x);

		1/4		   1/4		   1/4		    1/4
(D21) [x = (- 1)    %I, x = - (- 1)   , x = - (- 1)    %I, x = (- 1)   ]

which is right, but I expected the answer to be powers of
(1+%i)/sqrt(2).  I could add the rule

tellsimp((-1)^(1/4), (1+%i)/sqrt(2))

to get what I want.

A bug?

No.

(C6) solve(x^4+1=0,x);

                1/4                1/4             1/4              1/4

              2           2               2           2

Is  x  positive, negative, or zero?

One possible concern I have is that if the code can't
stand fixing such as that, it might be hard to improve
and maintain it.  Wouldn't we want the code robust
enough to be able to handle minor cleanups?   For
example, suppose something is broken, someone writes a
fix for it, and although the fix itself is clean and
well written some quirk in the code renders it
unusable.  If the policy is to write the fix in such a
way that it doesn't break anything, rather than fix
the quirk, and that results in some messy code, that
just makes the overall system harder to maintain the
next time someone wants to do something.  Over enough
iterations  mightn't that cause real trouble?

Again these are just my thoughts and concerns.  I
don't know if it would work this way or not.  It seems
like a concern worth voicing, though...

That reminds me, here's another thought. Maybe we can
branch into two distinct efforts here - those of us
who are currently able to understand the maxima code
can make improvements and fixes as they like, and the
rest of us can start going through the last stable
release (5.6, I think?) and begin to do a big
documentation effort - user manuals, annotated
examples for all types of problems, general
introductions into the how and why of Lisp and Maxima,
detailed descriptions of how the guts of maxima work
and which files do what and how, etc.  It will force
us to figure out what's going on, keep us out of the
hair of those who know what's going on internally, and
be useful at the same time.  I know there are a few
documentation people out there - should we try to
organize ourselves and make a good stab at this?

Also, did we decide on any uses of the sourceforge
maxima site?  I kind of get the sense that maybe the
best thing to do for a while, at least, is keep the
development stuff where it is, and make the
sourceforge site into kind of a point of entry for
newcomers and maybe a place to do some documentation
efforts?  I hate to see the site go to waste, and
right now there isn't much on it.  Comments?

I don't think anyone is saying don't fix broken things.  Just be
cautious because no one really knows all of the implications.
Or as Richard says, create a new file if you really want to make lots

I think that's the biggest question that needs to be answered.  Who is
the "official" maintainer?  Who gets write access to perform commits
on CVS files?

I have no problem if the official site stays where it is or is moved
to some other site.

But we need to decide who can actually commit changes and where they
will be.  Otherwise, we'll be wasting a bunch of time for naught.

Hi,

 I think that this is an excellent idea!  Also, it is interesting to look
through the Maxima share directories to see what applications have been
written in the past (although I am not sure of the status of some of these,
i.e., do they indeed work with the current version of Maxima?).  These files
might provide a starting point for such a collection.

I wouldn't think so.  (1+i)/sqrt(2) is only the principal value of
(-1)^(1/4), not *the* value.  The principal value of complex functions
isn't always called for.

My feeling about some "features" of Macsyma / Maxima is
that deserve to be anti-documented. That is, there are
some things that are so complicated that it is impossible
to document them, and so a better version, and its
documentation, should be provided.  Unfortunately
this requires good taste and maybe even some level
of consensus.  Most people don't want to look at,
critique, and reach consensus about someone else's
design.

For what it's worth...

I suspect that Wolfram's Mathematica book came about
this way
(1) Wolfram learns to use Macsyma
(2) Wolfram thinks he can do better
(3) With Geoff Fox and some others, writes SMP
(4) Tries to make money with SMP,
(5) SMP turns out to be a loser; start again
(6) Wolfram write a description of what a CAS should be
(7) He and others write a system to do that. Modify the
description as little as possible.


Documenting an existing system "after the fact" is
not so easy.

  I'm going to try to put online a
paper from the 1979 Macsyma Users' Conference
"Macsyma's General Simplifier: Philosophy and Operation"
(10 pages, single spaced).
Maybe that will help some of you.

Yes, but then I'd have to ask why

sqrt(-1) is %i and not (-1)^(1/2)

Anyway Boris gave me a way to get the rectangular form which is good
enough for what I was trying to do (convert an elliptical integral to
one of the canonical forms).

Then ask it; I think it's a good question.

My attempt at an answer would be that, by convention, i is often
considered to be *the* square root of -1.  Since in some sense i is
the basic complex number (the others are written in terms of i),
it doesn't make any difference whether you choose i or -i for
sqrt(-1), as long as you're consistent.

But then I've put very little thought into it.

Hi - For those who want some worked Maxima examples (I recall a few recent
messages in this regard), one place to look is the book by C.C. Mei:
  Mathematical Analysis in Engineering
by Cambridge University Press (1997 - paperback edition).  There is a fairly
long appendix on using Macsyma, but from what I see there it should work
with Maxima.  According to Fatbrain.com , this book is still available.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.33.0109261029480.11357-100000@stekt30>

I have made, actually quite a long time ago, a patch that
adds GNU Readline support for GCL, GNU Common Lisp, and
all Lisp programs including Maxima. It is available from:

http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~tuukkat/rel/gcl-2.3-readline3.patch.gz
(4 kilobytes).

Read first the beginning of the patch that explains how
to use it.

The problems with this patch: it might not cleanly apply
against GCL 2.4, but this is only a minor fix that anybody
should be able to do.

The real problem is that the word completion doesn't work
correctly except with statically linked Readline library.
During GCL compilation, the word list is created that contains
Lisp keywords, and similarly could be done for Maxima.

When the compiled GCL is dumped into an executable, Readline
forgets the keywords if it's linked in dynamically.

A solution would be to call the new Lisp keyword to initialize
Readline each time GCL/Maxima is started, but I don't know
a good place for this.

There is no algebraic difference between +I and -I, so one needs
make no difference between them. ONLY WHEN one fixes a topological
representation of $C$ as a plane (for example) and gives it an
orientation, etc... one gets a "real" difference, but from the
purely algebraic (and that is what a CAS does) point of view,
one cannot (is not able to) make any difference between "the" two
roots of x^2+1=0 over $R$. The fact could be stated as:

let us begin to work. Now, I need to work with the solution of
x^2+1. OK. If there is one, then there are two (characteristic
0, IMPORTANT). OK. Let us call one I. Let us call the other J.
Mmmmmh! It happens that J=-I. That's good! Then, instead of using
J, we shall use -I.


Hope this helps to clarify things.

You mean $C$?

In any case I think the arg function is well-defined function (if we
use the principal value) and arg(%i) is %pi/2, but arg(-%i) = -%pi/2.

I think they're different, but perhaps I don't follow you.

Try this:

(C4) ev(%,numer);

(D4) 				  SIN(%I + 1)

Should maxima return something more like

  1.2984575814159773 + 0.6349639147847361d0 %I

instead?

I rather miss this, especially since Lisp handles complex numbers.

Hm.  At some level Maxima agrees that (-1)^(1/4)=1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)

(C1) (-1)^(1/4);

                                        1/4
(D1)                               (- 1)
(C2) bfloat(%);

(D2)            7.071067811865475B-1 %I + 7.071067811865475B-1

And of course, even if Maxima were sensitive about branches of the
fourth root, using (1+i)/sqrt(2) in the solution above would give all
four solutions.

(This reminds me, for some reason, of the old demonstrations that 1=-1,
  1 = sqrt(1) = sqrt( -1  * -1) = sqrt(-1) * sqrt(-1) = i * i = -1
The mistake being, of course, that in general sqrt(a*b) isn't the same as
sqrt(a)*sqrt(b), unless you're willing to change which branch of the
square root you take.)

(D3) %I COS(1) SINH(1) +COSH(1) SIN(1)

OK

so i think that you define sin1(Z),
(C5) sin1(z) := trigexpand(sin(rectform(z));

(C6)sin1((1+%i)/sqrt(2));
(d6) %ICOS(1/sqrt(2))SINH(1/sqrt(2))+COSH(1/sqrt(2))SIN(1/sqrt(2))

This obviously works, but I find it a bit annoying that maxima doesn't
do this automatically when I ask it for a numerical value.

I think I know how to do this (at least it's working with my elliptic
function code[1]), but if no one thinks this is the right answer, then
perhaps I'm wrong about it.

Ray

Footnotes: 
[1]  This points out a small bug.  maxima defines its own versions of
asin, acos, atan, sinh, cosh, tanh, asinh, acosh, and atanh, which are
all standard Lisp functions.  This prevented me from computing
elliptic functions for complex args.  These should probably be
modified.  Plus I think the definitions for sinh, tanh, and perhaps
others lose precision for x near 0.

We control round error with this mechanism and our head,I think.
But we shoud introduce "Interval Computation" in maxima ,like maple or
mathematica.

At present state,unless reading source carefully,we cannot use maxima

We control round error with this mechanism and our head,I think.
But we shoud introduce "Interval Computation" in maxima ,like maple or
mathematica.

At present state,unless reading source carefully,we cannot use maxima.

I wrote

this essential point is rectform.
see

(C7)trigexpand(sin((1+%i)/sqrt(2)));
(d7) sin((1+%i)/sqrt(2))
(C8)%,numer;
(d8) sin((1+%i)/sqrt(2))

It is difficult to transform argument one pattern to
another,automatically.
At least you shoud read trigi.lisp carefully again.

Well, I don't think we're using our heads in this case.  

sinh(x) = 1/2*(exp(x) - exp(-x))
        = x + x^3/3! + x^5/5! + ...

So surely for small enough x, we should use our heads and use the
Taylor series (or something better) to evaluate sinh:

(C7) 1.0b-20 + (1.0b-20^3)/6;

(D7) 1.00000000000000000000000000000000000000001666666666666666666666666666666#

Note that CMUCL has a interval arithmetic package that is used by the
compiler to derive the types of numbers.  It's correct for integers,
but for floating-point, it doesn't round up and down appropriately.

I don't follow.

For my simp-%sn, I had some code like

	  ((and $numer (complex-number-p u)
		(complex-number-p m))
	   ;; For complex values.  Should we really do this?
	   (format t "real u = ~A~%" ($realpart u))
	   (format t "imag u = ~A~%" ($imagpart u))
	   (let ((result (sn (complex ($realpart u) ($imagpart u))
			     (complex ($realpart m) ($imagpart m)))))
	     (complexify result)))

Where complex-number-p was a function that looked at u to see it
looked like a number or a list of the form '((mplus) x ((mtimes) y
%i)).  complexify just took #c(a b) and converted it to '((mplus) a
((mtimes) b %i)).

There might be other implications about doing this, but in principal
this should work.

    go> At least you shoud read trigi.lisp carefully again.

To learn what?  Really, I want to know what you think I should learn
from reading this.

Hello,

there is a switch 'rectform' for the EV function, which gives the desired
result. 

Try ev(sin(%i+1),rectform). It returns 1.29...+0.63*%i.

Subject: [Maxima] mactex bugs and patch
Message-ID: <OF29A58ECD.2C3BC3EF-ON86256AD8.00607249@unk.edu>

Here are descriptions of some mactex bugs and my fixes. I've
included a diff file for the most recent version of mactex.
I believe patches comply with the proposed Maxima MPR
(minimal patch rule).

My Maxima is 5.6; GCL is 2.4; gcc is 2.91; and OS is RedHat 6.1.

1. ------------------------------
Problem: Missing parens in powers of symbolic summations and products:

(C4) tex((sum(a(k),k,0,n))^2);
$$\sum_{k=0}^{n}{a\left(k\right)}^2$$
(D4) FALSE
(C5)

Fix:  Change the tex right binding powers of %sum and %product:

(defprop %sum 110. tex-rbp)
(defprop %product 115. tex-rbp)

2. -------------------------------
Problem:  Powers of derivatives, integrals, and "at"

(C1) tex('(diff(f,x))^2);
$$DIFF^2\left(\left(f,x\right)\right)$$
(D1) FALSE

(C2) tex('at(f(x),x=3)^2);

$$%AT^2\left(f\left(x\right),x=3\right)$$
(D2) FALSE

Fix:  In tex-mexpt, change

   (not (memq f '(%sum %product))) ;; what else? what a hack...

to

    (not (memq f '(%sum %product %derivative %integral %at))) ;; what else? what a hack...


3. -------------------------------
Problem:  Multiple subscripts:

(C2) tex(f[1][2]);
$$
Error: ((|$f| SIMP ARRAY) 1) is not of type SYMBOL.

Fix: Change tex-array to do the right thing when (eq 'mqapply (caar x)).
New tex-array is (only changed (setq l ...)

(defun tex-array (x l r)
  (let ((f))
    (if (eq 'mqapply (caar x))
     (setq f (cadr x)
           x (cdr x)
           l (tex f (append l (list "\\left(")) (list "\\right)") 'mparen 'mparen))
      (setq f (caar x)
         l (tex (texword f) l nil lop 'mfunction)))
    (setq
     r (nconc (tex-list (cdr x) nil (list "}") ",") r))
    (nconc l (list "_{") r  )))

4. -------------------------------
Problem: Trailing space missing in some infix operators:

(C3) tex(a <= b);
$$a\leqb$$
(D3) FALSE

Fix:  Add the spaces, for example, change

     (defprop mgeqp ("\\leq") texsym)

to

    (defprop mgeqp ("\\leq ") texsym)

5. --------------------------------
Problem:  Double floats:

(C7) tex(1.3d-99);
$$
Error: The function STRCAT is undefined.

Fix: Define strcat for gcl:

#+(or cmu gcl) ;; any others?
(defun strcat (&rest args)
  (apply #'concatenate 'string (mapcar #'string args)))

6. --------------------------------
Problem:  Typo in (defun tex-d(x dsym) prevents diff operator in numerator
from being \\partial.


Fix:  Change

    (numer `((mexpt) $|d| ((mplus) , at ords))) ; d^n numerator

To
    (numer `((mexpt) dsym ((mplus) , at ords))) ; d^n numerator

Also change the comment from

    (defun tex-d(x dsym) ;dsym should be $d or "$d\\partial"

to
    (defun tex-d(x dsym) ;dsym should be $d or "$\\partial"

Subject: [Maxima] Elliptic function support
Message-ID: <4ng093ktut.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

--=-=-=


Here is a replacement for maxima's ellipt.lisp.  The current version
basically just numerically evaluates some of the elliptic functions.
The key changes:

o The elliptic functions sn(u|m), cn(u|m), dn(u|m) are defined.
  Maxima knows about some special values of these and knows how to
  differentiate wrt to the first parameter.  When given numerical
  args, Maxima will compute the value.
o The inverse functions asn, acn, and adn are defined.  Maxima knows
  how to evaluate these and find the derivative wrt to the first
  parameter. 
o The elliptic functions F(phi|m) and E(phi|m) are defined.  Maxima
  knows about some special values, and and compute them when given
  numerical args.  Maxima knows how to differentiate them.

Missing things:
o Maxima doesn't know how to compute the integrals of the elliptic
  functions, even though they're easily defined in terms of other
  elliptic functions.

I think I got them defined correctly, but some bugs may still exist.
There are a lot of changes, so no diff is given.

Hope this is useful to someone,

Ray

Good day,

I think the "solve" function is broken. I just installed Maxima and 
tried solving a few elementary equations. In all cases but the very, 
very elementary ones, Maxima is no good, it seems. (See below.)


What am I missing? Surely, Maxima can do this?

Hi - Try this for a start (on the expression with the logs):
  logexpand:true;
  solve(log(a*x)-C*log(b*x),x);

 I have not yet found anything similar for exponentials...

I ask because I'm a prof. at Acadia U. and we are currently teaching 
calculus using Maple. I'm trying to see if Maxima could be used instead. 
So I've tested some problems we asked the students to solve using Maple. 
It would seem like Maxima fails at solving all of them!!!!

It would seem that you argument is "Maxima assumes everything to be 
complex numbers and so your problem is too hard". Fine. Can I tell 
Maxima to consider everything in terms of real numbers??? (My students 
don't even know what a complex number is... let alone DeMoivre's 
formula!!!!!!!!!!)

I don't know. Looks to me like...

solve(exp(a*x)= C*exp(b*x),x);


should give me

x = log(C)/(a-b) or something like this (I might be getting the sign 
wrong). Of course, if I allow a and b to be complex... or x to be 
complex... but why would I want to do this?
How is that non trivial? All you have to do is apply the log on both 
sides of the equation.

Plus...

  solve(a^x=b^x,x);

should give me x = 0. Sure, there might be many solutions... but that's 
one of them, for sure!

  solve(log(a*x)=C*log(b*x),x);

should give me x = ((b^c)/a)^(1/c) or at least some kind of answer... 
just take "exp(" on both sides and solve! (I might have my answer wrong 
btw).

And so on...

I mean, beside solving polynomial equations, Maxima doesn't seem to do 
much (in terms of solving!).

Also, is there a way to make sure the doc. is available even when I'm 
not connected to a network? Can't I see the doc. from maxima locally?

Subject: [Maxima] Documentation Questions
In-Reply-To: <4ng093ktut.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>
Message-ID: <20011001230054.93961.qmail@web12202.mail.yahoo.com>

Well, since there is some agreement that a documentation effort is a
good idea, I guess I might as well venture to throw out some specific
questions/ideas and see what everyone's got in mind.

Question 1:  Structure of Documentation - i.e., what do we need?

     What we currently have, as I understand it, is the online help in
maxima itself, the reference manual, and a few other misc. introductory
documents.  Here are my thoughts on what might be a good way to focus:

  1)  Tutorial/Users Manual

     The limitation I think most people have when they look at Maxima
initially is just having no clue where to start, and even after they
start not being able to figure out how to do any particular thing
without a fair bit of effort.  This document should be structured in a
task oriented manner - i.e., how to make Maxima do specific types of
things.   Say for example someone wants to perform a series of matrix
operations - the tutorial should take a problem based approach, showing
which tools can do which job, the exact syntax used, what the pitfalls
of a particular approach might be, etc.    

   2)  The Reference Manual

      This can build off of the manual we already have, with the main
effort being to keep it up to date for new packages, fixes, etc. and to
test the behavior of what's already described in the manual, making
sure everything is accurate, clearing up confusing parts, etc.

   3)  Programmer's Manual

      This one I have fewer concrete ideas about, except that it should
define a coding standard.  Richard has had some good suggestions about
principles to adhere to when working on Maxima - those should
definitely be in here.  Also, this would be the place to maybe start on
an effort to map the guts of Maxima - what depends on what, how various
parts work, etc.



Question 2:  What do we use?

   Docbook seems to be the standard for documentation these days, but I
don't think it has much in the way of mathmatical markup capability. 
LaTeX can handle almost any math formatting, but is not the standard
documentation format.  However, it  has BibTeX and lots of nifty
scientific writing features.  Currently we don't need graphical markup
in Maxima, since everything is ascii text, so Docbook can probably
serve our current needs.  Anyone with experience in this department?  I
have no idea what would be best. 


Question 3:  Documentation's relation to Maxima updates

   If and when we get the documentation to a point where it makes sense
to do so, should we have some sort of policy that before any release
all the changes need to be updated in the documentation?


Those are the major points I have come up with thus far - comments
please.  This is by no means a definite proposal or statement of what
we should do - this is just something to get discussion going.

Good day,

I'm not sure "solve(log(lhs(%))=log(rhs(%)),x);" seems like an 
interesting thing to do. Isn't that fairly complicated? Sure, you end up 
getting the answer... but it is probably longer than working out the 
problem on some scrap paper.

Ok, well, let's suppose it is ok. Now, let me have a look at the SCSIMP 
command... let's take an obvious case...

(C1) SCSIMP(a*(sin(x))^2 +a*(cos(x))^2 );
				      2		  2
(D1) 				 a SIN (x) + a COS (x)


Again, it would seem like Maxima fails miserably...  and I'm not even 
taking a very difficult case!

What gives? Is Maxima really useless? (And I don't want that to be true! 
I've read somewhere that someone spent 15 years on this piece of 
software!!!)


This is really depressing... I was about to switch to Maxima... I could 
do easily with a crappy interface, a few bugs, some missing features... 
but it seems to me (please prove me wrong) that the symbolic features 
are totally useless for any serious applications.

Sure, you can draw plots, but so can gnuplot. Sure you can do some 
calculations, but then so can gnuplot... So far, I haven't found 
anything that gnuplot couldn't do better.

I really wish I could throw away Maple, Mathcad and all that... but it 
seems like it is nowhere near happening!

I'm not sure what logexpand does, but clearly, we are nowhere near 
finding a solution to log(a*x)=C*log(b*x) for x!!!

See what I get...


(C1) logexpand:true;


(D1) 					  TRUE
(C2) solve(log(a*x)=C*log(b*x),x);


					     LOG(a x)
(D2) 				 [LOG(b x) = --------]

Hi Ray,
.0001 is a number between .000095 and .00015, so maximas' answer isn't that 
bad.
If what you wanted was sinh(1/1000) with standard precision, you can have 
that:

(C1) sinh(1/1000),numer;
(D1) 					        0.00100000016667

You say,
Again, it would seem like Maxima fails miserably...  and I'm not even 
taking a very difficult case!

Why not try some function f(x)= stuff,
where f is sin, cos, linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic.

  instead of	f(x)=g(x) where neither f nor g
has a single-valued inverse.



Isolating a variable on one side of the equation by doing
(generally) illegal transformations is not something
people tend to put into algorithms that are supposed to
do correct mathematics.

Expecting such a system to perform your way (without
complex numbers) would require Maxima to fail to
solve x^2+1=0.  Whle programs could be written
to do this, you may have to do it yourself.

The commercial Macsyma does some of the problems
you indicate, by the way.

You might also learn to use the tools like expand, factor,
ratsimp, trigsimp, etc.  Solve may not
do what you want, but there are other tricks available.
If you want to write a program that mimics a naive
math student and uses only the techniques you have taught,
then that can be done.

Yes, I agree completely with this what you said. A good starting point
is the intro.html "Maxima Primer", that comes at least with Maxima 5.6.

>   2)  The Reference Manual

Yes, and in addition I suggest that it'll be kept in one language.
I don't have anything particular against French, but nevertheless
I hope that the French parts will be translated into English. The
original French text should probably be saved anyway, if someone
will make make a full French version of the manual someday.

Look for example documentation of functions CONT2PART, CONT2PUI.
Furthermore, these functions didn't seem to work. If it requires
that something is load()'ed before, this should be mentioned in the manual.

>Question 2:  What do we use?

I myself would like to have a LaTeX documentation. Although the
Maxima commands itself are text-based, it would probably help
people to see the corresponding things written in standard math
notations.

The GNU standards use info, but I don't like it =)

>Question 3:  Documentation's relation to Maxima updates

Maybe there should be two kinds of releases: stable and development.
With stable releases everything should be perfect, including the
documentation. With development releases it wouldn't matter so much.

The stable release should be the target, so that even if some piece
doesn't have documentation, it at least would be on the list of
things-to-do.

Lots of talk, little deed. Sorry. I'd like to help but I can't
preallocate any fixed amount of my time to the work. And worse,
I don't understand Maxima or computer algebra systems much anyway.
But if there's something easy to do, and no better people for the task,
let me know :)

I'm very happy that there seems to be very skillful people going
to sacrifice their time to Maxima. Thank you all.

The documentation for solving equations says that SOLVERADCAN allows
more equations with exponentials and logarithms to be solved.
  
  SOLVERADCAN:TRUE;
  SOLVE(log(a*x)=C*log(b*x),x);

does the trick.

Reading the section on Trigonometric functions says to use TRIGSIMP
for simplifying trigonometric expressions.

TRIGSIMP(a*sin(x)^2+a*cos(x)^2);

will work.

 > solve(exp(a*x)= C*exp(b*x),x);

>From reading the description of SOLVE I decided to give it a helping
hand by dividing by EXP(b*x),
 
q:EXP(a*x)=C*EXP(b*x);
SOLVE(q/EXP(b*x),x);

which works ok.  Probably a guru can point out a better way.  I only
started learning about the SOLVE command this morning.

On Unix the manual should automatically be installed as an info file.

Otherwise there's a pdf file at http://www.ma.utexas.edu/maxima.html
that you can download.

I find these types of arguments insufficient.  Unless we are doing
interval arithmetic, how do you know what precision my number is?  I
may have 1e-4 plus or minus the least significant bit.  Then the
answer isn't all that good.

I think algorithms should return as accurate an answer as possible
(within reason).  Let me figure out whether the result has any meaning
or not.  

If we have interval arithmetic, then maxima can figure out what the
result is.

    rgen> sinh(1/1000) with standard precision, you can have that:

    rgen> (C1) sinh(1/1000),numer; (D1) 0.00100000016667

Well, except that I wanted 1e-4:

(C6) sinh(1/10000),numer;

(D6) 				    1.0E-4

Which is pretty bad in my book, especially since it's quite easy to
get a better answer.  Especially since maxima decided to implement
sinh itself instead of letting the underlying Lisp evaluate it.  (A
historical artifact, probably.)

Maxima's describe command is pretty tightly coupled to info since it
has a builtin info file parser/reader.  I use this feature a lot since
I can never remember all of the commands, options, and syntax.

Could probably replace this with something like spawning off a process
to bring up a Web browser to the appropriate place.  This is rather
nice if the hyperlinks are set up.  Maybe be able to steal what Clisp(?)
has done with in this area.

Look around and find something whose documentation you like,
and copy that concept.
   Do you like the mathematica "bible"  and its on-line version?
   Do you like the commercial macsyma stuff?
   Do you like documentation for (say) Word or Excel?

I think Apple stuff used to, maybe still does, come with
books called "before you begin...".

It may also help to have targeted audiences.

I still find the idea of having one person write a program
and another one "document" it 20 or 30 years later to be
bizarre.  But that is what we have as a task.

Hi - I intended to write logexpand:super , which does solve the problem.
Generally speaking, with most computer algebra systems you have to give the
program some assistance at some stage in the calculation.  I think that this
is the point that Dr. Fateman was trying to get across; you have to be
willing to use things like expand and factor.

Personally I do - in my experience it has been helpful.

Their quick reference sheets, the only macsyma docs I've seen, are
nice.  I don't know where to locate a copy of the full commercial
macsyma documentation - it sure doesn't seem to be online.  Since that
would more than likely be very useful for us, does anyone know of an

That's probably a very good idea - moreover, for the educational side
of things, maybe we can write a few "training wheel" packages which
will make some basic assumptions that ordinarily wouldn't be made for
real world use, to address uses such as those that have been mentioned
over the past few days.  I do think we should have some general
documentation for the basics, but since a lot of the stuff people have
said they plan to port to maxima will be very specific to one thing or
another it wouldn't make sense under most cases to include those in a
general doc.

Yep.  Just the nature of the game, I guess.

Well, I don't really have a clue about stuff like this, but why
couldn't we teach the solve package to try some of the expand and
factor stuff itself?  If it doesn't like the form that's given, try
changing it around a bit before abandoning the effort?

As someone who primarily works on Unix, having documents in Word/Excel
is not good.  (I can use StarOffice, but only if I have to.)

Since you seem to think this is easy, feel free to write such
a program! Note that some of the programs that you might try
(a) destroy some of the solutions
(b) create extraneous solutions
(c) can take extremely long times
(d) explode a problem into huge size
(e) still might not help.

Note that almost any computation done by a computer algebra
system could be thought of as 
solve(<something>)  and therefore you have almost no
guidance as to what is really required as an answer.
Numerical approximation?
Solution over the complex numbers?
Taylor series?
Algebra or differential or difference or .... equations?

Do you want solve to be able to do this:

solve(f(x)^2-f(x)=0,f)  ?


PS.  It is unlikely that solve likes or does not like forms
of input :)
You could try writing what amounts to a bunch of rules,
as a first stab at it.

As I've said, I didn't know enough to know if it could be done or not. 
I'm quite willing to accept the more informed opinion that there is no
simple or worthwhile way to do it. I just figured maybe there was some
other reason for not putting it in besides difficulty, like keeping the
code clean or that such methods weren't generally useful, but evidently
that isn't the case.

That's sort of what I ment - I seem to recall somewhere an example of
an integral being possible only if you used some expand operations and
such, but I guess that was different from the solve case.

Maple solution is 100% valid given the proper (obvious) assumptions. The 
fact that there might exist other solutions is irrelevant. It doesn't 
make Maple answer bogus.

When I ask a student to solve an equation, I will certainly give a lot 
more marks if he writes down one solution, possibly forgetting a few 
other cases, than if he just does nothing.

One question remain: can I write some configuration file such that these 
will be turned on by default whenever I use Maxima!!! I understand that 
computationally expensive options might be turned off by default. Then I 
want the opposite. I want that the next time I'll enter Maxima, all the 
"good" options be turned on so I can enjoy the full power of Maxima (as 
I see it). Is there a way to setup a configuration file? Or else, what 
is the least inconvenient way to go about it?

I've used Mathematica and Maple for years and years now. I know how they 
work. I know what to expect in terms of limitations. The problems I gave 
were solved by Maple and Mathematica. Don't tell me it is beyond 
computer algebra. That's just not true. If it were, people wouldn't use 
compute algebra!

This being said, I'm starting to see that we can reduce the limitations 
that Maxima seem to have by turning on many switches. I only need now to 
switch these one automatically (or at least a good bunch of them).

Yes, it does, thank you! It is unfortunate that it does nothing to help
solve(exp(a*x)=C*exp(b*x),x);. You did, however, improve my confidence
in the tool (I'm not convinced just yet though).

Yes, fine, it works if you simplify the equation yourself first. There
was another idea in the same direction before. Basically, if Maxima
doesn't work, you just rewrite your equation in various ways until it
does solve it. I'd rather have a better answer if you have one. That's
just not very convincing.

These two problems : EXP(a*x)=C*EXP(b*x)
   and a*(sin(x))^2+a*(cos(x))^2 are still two relatively easy problem
that make maxima choke as far as I can tell. (Please, prove me wrong!)

Good day,

I'm not sure what you are talking about, both exp() and log() are 
one-to-one (bijective) functions.


So,

A = B


if and only if (assuming A,B>0)



log(A) = log(B)

and

A = B

if and only if

exp(A) = exp(B).

Of course, assuming real numbers (that's what I do here). So, I wasn't 
expecting anything *unsafe* from Maxima.

Even so, I would expect even the most stupid computer algebra system to 
simplify

A* sin^2 (x) + A * cos^2(x)

to

A

otherwise, it might as well not exist.

I did put "Newbie" in the subject line to indicate that I didn't 
necessarily know the software very well. So I'm not saying Maxima is 
useless, I'm just saying that it appears to be useless right now to me.

Ah! So I could use...

  simplify(a):=trigsimp(scsimp(a));


Great!@:-)

Now, I'm asking this again... is there a way to make create some kind of 
default configuration where, for example, I could define my simplify 
function above... I'd like this setup is such a way that it will run 
everytime I launch maxima. What is the least inconvenient way of doing this?

Thanks!

Hi - You can do this easily by putting statements such as
 logexpand:super;
into a text file (e.g., blah.mc) and then typing (when you first start
Maxima):
 batch("blah.mc")$
I'm sure that there are other (better) ways of doing this too.  You could
invoke this at any time during a session.

 I'm not saying that these problems are "beyond" computer algebra in any
way!  All I am saying is that is that you may not necessarily be able to
solve some equation with just one command; the idea is to manipulate it into
a more suitable form (e.g., using expand or factor) and to then apply solve.
You have to think in a slightly different way when approaching a problem
with computer algebra.

 Incidentally, I have used Maple for a number of years and there are many
situations in which I find it frustrating to use.

This is false in general, since exp(x)=exp(x+4*pi*i), and x is not
equal to x+4*pi*i.
Why do you think that the solution of logarithmic and exponential
equations is of any interest over the real numbers?

Aha, so you must in your own mind have an algorithm in mind that
will reduce all expressions involving sin^2 and cos^2 to simplest
form.  In which case what would you like for
 sin^2x + 2*cos^2x?   cos^2x+1  or 2-sin^2x ?   And by what
algorithm did you achieve this?
Your expectation may further be reduced by the knowledge that
Daniel Richardson proved that one cannot write an algorithm
to determine if an expression is zero or not, given that it
involves rational combinations of one variable, the integers,
the sin and abs functions, and pi.

It is not unusual in the CAS business to surprise people in
that some things that are easy for humans turn out to be,
in general, not computable.  And other things that humans
find difficult, or may think are impossible (like finding all
factors of a polynomial of high degree), are easily computed.

It may very well be useless to you.  I am surprised however
that Maple and Mathematica meet your needs, since they have
each been eliminated as unsuitable for the calculus class
at UC Berkeley: they gave wrong answers.

Type the command exactly as given above.  It will work.  You typed
something different.

You can have any set of macsyma commands read in each time you
start up the program by putting the commands in a particular
file.  It is something like c:\.macsyma-init , but probably
not EXACTLY like that.  The difficult is that
wrapping trigsimp(scsimp())  aroundevery command,  is probably not
a good idea.

Hi, all,

There has been some talk about how to deliver documentation.  You all 
might want to take a look at R ( at http://cran.r-project.org/ ).  This 
has a really slick documentation facility, which includes their function 
package.skeleton(), which takes a list of functions, data sets, and so 
on, and produces, among other things, template files for the programmer 
to fill out for each of them.  This eases the task of documenting what 
you've done.  R has some of the best help files I've seen, and I suspect 
that this is why.  

The really slick part is the delivery.  When a package is installed part 
of the job is to generate dvi and html documentation from the 
document.Rd files (except on windows, I gather).  The .Rd files have a 
markup language which is essentially LaTeX.  What I mean by that is that 
it uses the LaTeX syntax in a way that causes no surprises to me where 
it can be rendered sensibly in html, and lets you embed real LaTeX code 
for equations, e.g., \eqn{put the latex version here}{put the ascii 
version here} will give the dvi file the proper equation and will give 
the best approximation you can dream up for the html file.

When you execute the function help.start(), R starts a browser 
(typically netscape) which displays the html help pages.  The dvi pages 
are generated from the same files, so there is never a problem with the 
two being out of sync.  

R is GPL'ed, so copying would be easy, except that it's not written in 
Lisp.  I am fairly sure, from what I remember of the documentation, that 
the facilities for building the help files are written in Perl.  I would 
think that requiring Perl is not unreasonable on a Unix system.  Windows 
will simply have to have binaries with no building required, anyway.

I hope that this gives you all some usable ideas.

Has anyone done any work with IZIC?  Apparently it's one of the
plotting tools maxima can talk to, and from the screenshots on the
website - http://www-sop.inria.fr/safir/SAM/Izic/ - it's a fairly nice
piece of work.  Unfortunately, after I finally got it downloaded, I
discovered it had apparently been written for tk3.6.  

Will this require basically redoing the interface to get it to work?

I specifically said that I was assuming all my variables and constants

the message you are answering to.

I won't even answer that question. It *obvious* why logs and exps are

I'm not an algebra specialist. I don't have such an algorithm, however 
both Maple and Mathematica behave as I expect in such simple cases (and 
in much more difficult cases also).

I have no trouble believing that result. Nobody ever said that a 
computer algebra system had to be perfect.

Do you have a reference to this comparative study? I'd like to have a look! It is exactly the type of thing I'm looking for right now!

Is there any way to save files in Maxima without fiddling in the menus?

What I'd like to do is write a batch file that would generate several 
plots when Maxima runs it (like you do with gnuplot).


To me, this is very convenient when writting a paper because I can 
easily modify and correct my plots later simply by correcting my 
equations and running the batch file again!

If it does what I expect, what's the problem?

I don't overwrite the basic function, I define a new one.

Ok thanks for the tip, I'll look into it to see where the file you are

Good day,

I know when something *could* be done and is not being done. I know when 
something is not being done for good reasons. The examples I gave were 
problems Maxima has to be able to solve. So far, I've learned that half 
of the could be solved using the right settings.

We are left with the other half. Why is it that other Computer Systems 
can solve these and not Maxima? Well, I'm looking at it right now, 
trying to figure out if I can go from 50% to 100% the same way I went 
from 0% to 50%.

There is no way I will accept having to factor and expand stuff. I use 
Computer Algebra to save time, not waste it. Other packages are beyond 
that now. Maxima has to match (in some way) the abilities of the other 
packages. Unfortunately, I'm not an algebra specialist and I cannot be 
expected to expand  Maxima.

It is.

I'm very much a Mathcad user and it is very frustrating. Not to mention 
that it is a proprietary solution and I don't think my (freely 
available, publishable, reproducible) research should be based on 
proprietary software.

Some think for teaching. I would feel much better teaching a course 
using free (as in "open source") software rather than feeding some 
marketing hype.


So far though, Maxima has shown itself to be even more frustrating (what is it with the evil user interface?).


I'm ready to cope with this just to see if it is a learning curve thing 
or if Maxima is really frustrating.

Agreed. But then, let's start by having a computer system that can give 
*one* solution to begin with.

A most strange idea when applied to comuter programs. I certainly
would rather want my computer not to give me any answer than to give
me a wrong one. Hint: an omitted solution might be a cause of a major
disaster if the results are applied to an engineering project.

Yes, I know you said it several times.  Do you also teach your students
that the quadratic equation x^2+1=0 has no roots, since all your variables
and constants are real?  If so, that seems to be unfortunate.

I am reminded of an old joke,
"How many legs does a sheep have if you call its tail a leg?"

Answer:

Four.  Calling its tail a leg does not make it a leg.

Cheers.

How can I correct the situation? I tried describe(catch). It seems to me the

Note that call

Another thought along those lines is hyperlatex

Written in emacs lisp. Which is good or bad depending on what you

I use it fairly often for simple web page authoring.

I'm not sure it does what I want. I would want something like...

PLOT2D_PS (x,[x,0,10], "myfile_x.eps");
PLOT2D_PS (x^2,[x,0,10], "myfile_x2.eps");
PLOT2D_PS (log(x),[x,0.1,10], "myfile_log.eps");

x^2+1 = 0 has no real roots. The same way, log and exp as real functions 
  are one-to-one and thus invertible.

I'm not sure where this is leading to and how it relates to Maxima in 
any way. You want everything to be in terms of complex numbers all the 
time, fine. In reality, though, we use different sets according to our 
needs. In introductory calculus, we teach that exp(x) is a one-to-one 
function.

Whether or not we should teach calculus mixed with complex numbers and 
never talk about functions of real numbers seem irrelevant to my current 
concerns with Maxima.

Maybe we should solve x^2+1 is some Galois ring? Right? Then what?

There is nothing special about the complex numbers. It just so happen 
that most scientist use the real numbers or the integers more often than 
not. Then some people (like myself) work with complex numbers... other 
work with other rings and so on...

If you want a full discussion on the solutions of

x^2+1

for all possible rings, you better have a lot of time on your hands!!!

Most scientists don't have that much time!

While it is possible to use expand and factor, for the computer system
to take these steps on its own might be risky.  For example, expanding
(x+1)^100000 is really not a great idea.  By the way, using ratsimp
or ratexpand may be a lot faster than using expand.

Factoring can also be quite expensive.


As for x^2+1=0 being solved in other domains (e.g. in a
finite field)... it may seem to a mathematician that the
choice of real/ complex / etc / etc.  is arbitrary.  But
to an engineer, physicist, chemist, biologist, economist,
.... the choice not arbitrary at all.  
Complex is right, 99.999% of the time.

The goal of the
computer algebra systems like Macsyma, Maple, Mathematica..
are primarily to support applied mathematics, not
pure math.  There are other systems with more specialized
objectives that are efficient in (for example) group
theory calculations or number theory calculations.
While one can do arithmetic in a finite field in Macsyma
by setting modulus:2    or modulus:13   etc,
the support for this is spotty.  The Axiom system
is/was much better for this. But that may be related
to the fact that its current owner, NAG, is dropping
support for it.

In real life, assuming you don't yet know what to expect as an answer... 
what are you going to do? Try expand, solve, simplify, expand, solve, 
expand, simplify... at random until you get some kind of result...

Beside, in at least one of the example I gave, it doesn't work. Expand 
and factor don't simplify the problem so that solve will work. So, often 
, this is random work without even a good chance of succeeding.

The fact that other software does it easily mean that my expectations 
are reasonable here. Of course, here it is a simple case where we can 
see right away the answer.

What I'm interested in solving are problems more difficult where I 
cannot tell right away what the answer is. In these cases, expand, 
factor and the like are *not* going to help. I often work with functions 
over matrices to matrices. In such cases, you simply cannot play with 
your equations until the "just work". Other tools get it right, I need 
for Maxima to get it right too.

Subject: [Maxima] proprietary software vs hardware
Message-ID: <3BBB42B7.3060803@ondelette.com>

Good day,

 >Are you also going to stop doing your research on proprietary
hardware?<

That's an interesting question.

My point is that my work should not depend on one company's will. What 
if I prepare a paper, doing all the work in some proprietary software 
and then 2 years later, this company no longer exist or has chosen to 
retire their product? The software I might have chosen to publish has 
now become useless. A more likely scenario is that I want a colleague to 
  have access to my work, but I'm a Mathcad user and he's a Maple user. 
He tend has to go out, buy Maple and so on.

I much prefer the scenario where I publish a file, and anyone with very 
little effort can download the software for free in order to be able to 
use my work.

What about proprietary hardware?

That's different because I don't software for the specific hardware. The 
person interested in using my work doesn't have to buy a specific 
hardware from a specific company. If my software is as portable as it 
can be (and scripts written for Maxima are certainly portable), then it 
would be like writting software for Maple that could also run under 
Mathematica and Maxima. It would then be ok because the person doesn't 
need to deal with a specific company or buy anything it shouldn't have 
in the first place.

I see you are with Ericsson. Well, I wouldn't want to publish something 
that requires people to get a specific device, say a cell phone, from 
Ericsson. Of course, sometimes, it is a necessary evil, but if I can 
avoid it, I would! I would much rather write something that can run 
under any cell phone having the right features.

It doesn't mean you don't do it... but if you can avoid having your work 
to depend on some company's arbitrary specifications... I think it is great!

So, programming either for proprietary hardware or software is evil 
(hehehe!), but what I do for my PC is not "hardware programming". You 
can use Java, ANSI C++, Maxima scripts, and so on... and all of these 
are hardware independent. The same way, I try to remain OS independent.

If I go to such length, it is because I believe that on the long run, it 
pays!


I wrote my M.Sc. using a proprietary word processor (AmiPro) and I 
couldn't open my thesis now even if I wanted to. I wrote my early 
software using Turbo Pascal (yes, I'm that old) and Delphi. All of this 
software is now obselete and down the garbage can. However, I got wiser 
later on and started writing my software in Java and portable C++. All 
of this code is still with me... for a long, long time. My Ph.D. thesis 
is in LaTeX, and I try to write my papers using LaTeX and it works 
great. I don't worry about companies changing their product line or 
going out of business.

All my work now can be done both under Linux and Windows. I know because 
I use both every single day. I don't depend at all on OS.

I do depend on PC software... only up to a point because I moved 
everything I could on my Visor and on my gaming consoles. Sure, Visor is 
proprietary technology (not as much as one might think!), but the 
formats and software I'm using are open (and I write my Palm software in 
Java). If I could move across a greater range of hardware, I would.


You have to think about what will happen to your work in 10 years. Will 
Maxima still be there, available for download? It is likely if it is any 
good and if people gather around it (that's what I'm trying to 
determine). However, as for proprietary software, you never know... and 
even when it is still around, older file formats are never supported... 
because businesses make a point of forcing you to upgrade (uselessly).

My philosophy? Use open software, hardware and formats whenever possible.

Subject: [Maxima] Good enough algebra
Message-ID: <3BBB4372.3060804@ondelette.com>

Can you explain what you are talking about?

What wrong answer?


I'm sure there are bugs in Maple, Mathematica and Maxima, but I don't 
tend to believe that Maple will often give a wrong answer. The chances 
of that are much lower than me getting the wrong sign or something.

Certainly, in none of the examples given so far does Maple give a wrong 
answer. Sure, Maple makes some reasonable assumption, but that's what 
all Computer Algebra system do.

You have to be careful. Wrong and "not as complete as possible" are two 
different things.

Maple isn't "as complete as possible", but neither is "Maxima". So let's 
stop referring to this mythical software solving equations in such a way 
that all possible solutions are *always* found with all the cases worked 
out.

I want Maxima to be "good enough". If I wanted perfect software, I'd be 
a fool. Currently, I'm trying to decide whether Maxima is really good 
enough for me.

It is certainly better than what I thought a few days ago.


 >A most strange idea when applied to comuter programs. I certainly
would rather want my computer not to give me any answer than to give
me a wrong one. Hint: an omitted solution might be a cause of a major
disaster if the results are applied to an engineering project.<

There is texinfo, which can output dvi, html, and info.  One of those

Good day,

I still don't think it is reasonable. If the only support the computer 
is providing me is a set of functions to modify expression manually (do 
this, do that), then it is of no use. (Mind you, that's not what Maxima 
does, but that's what you seem to be arguing it should do.)

For simple problems, I will do it faster with pen and paper.

For harder problems, it will just fail because charting my route amounts 
to do it the hard work. I want the computer here to do the grunt work 
for me.

I'm not saying that it is the case for Maxima... I'm referring to the 
mythical software that should require the user to know the steps 
involved in solving the problem before having it solve it.

If it cannot solve without human assistance the problems we ask our 
"introductory calculus" students to do by computer, it is a big "No No" 
as a research tool for me.

And don't tell me that because it is free, open source, it is "ok" for 
it not to be competitive. I don't use "free" software because it is 
inexpensive, I use it because I expect it to serve me better. Again, I'm 
not saying Maxima wouldn't serve me better... I'm referring to the 
comments I've read.

Let's call a cat, a cat...

If Maxima can't do it because it is beyond Maxima, then please, just say 
that Maxima can't do it (yet?). Don't tell me that the problem we have 
our calculus students solving down in the lab, 100 meters from my 
office, cannot be solved by computer. Don't tell me I don't understand 
computer algebra.

The truth, it seems, is that Maxima cannot solve

exp(a * x) = C * exp(b * x)

Either it can solve it or not. If I have to manually divide throughout 
by exp(b * x), then it cannot solve it on its own, period. It is lacking 
in that regard with respect to commercial tools.


The correct thing to do is to put this problem on the "to do" list and 
say "such as such tool does it, then Maxima, surely, could do it, if 
someone shows up looking for a way to contribute, here's what he could do".

  I know how it works.I wrote a lot of GPL software. Go and look. My 
software has limitations. I don't expect perfect software... however, if 
my software cannot do something it should be able to do (if only because 
competing software do it), I won't start arguing that it is "how it 
works". If you don't want your user to speak up, the community is never 
going to build great software.

I just get mad when people say things like... "the problem isn't with 
the software, it is with you..." You have to be very careful when you 
say this... because software should serve humans, not the other way 
around. Software should work help the work of humans, not shape the work 
they do. It is up to the software to get better. Humans won't get 
smarter any time soon. Software can much more easily adapt. This type of 
answer has been given by Mac fanatics for years... "we don't have 
multitasking, but real multitasking is not good anyhow, that's not how 
it should work", "we have limited memory management, but that's not a 
defect, it is a feature". When you start thinking like this, bugs don't 
get fixed, features don't get implemented. That's how Apple almost died.

Come on!

I've run Maxima several times on my Linux box. As I ran it again and 
again, my machine started to get slower and slower. Yet, Maxima wasn't 
"on". I did "ps -A" to discover that several Maxima processes were 
running unattended. I'm afraid to report this as a bug because people 
are going to start arguing that it is a feature and that it is up to me 
to run "kill" after I execute a piece of software.

If the community wants to be serious about this, you need a RFE (request 
for enhancement) list and a bug list. It is quite alright to say that 
this RFE is probably not going to happen because of this or that... but 
the community shouldn't reject RFE and bug reports on the basis that it 
is the "user's fault" or "this software is free".

This has nothing to do with blaming the authors at this point. This is 
just great and I'm really looking forward to day when I'll be using 
Maxima all the time... I only want to help by reporting what I think 
should be improved and what should be corrected. I only want Maxima to 
be better than the commercial alternatives. I assure you that it doesn't 
make me happy to say the opposite...

You should probably give a reference and/or some context as to what

"You" who?

Pencil and paper is good.

Anyhow, from the subject and the following excerpt (I didn't find the
parent article)

it looks like you want Maxima to do some simplification.
The problem is that "simplify" is very vague, and which of two
expressions is simpler depends very much on what needs to be done with
it.  So if you want Maxima to simplify an expression, Maxima needs to
know what you mean by "simplify".  So there are a lot of choices
(expand, factor, etc.).  
If you are talking about using Maxima to solve an equation, then I
agree that Maxima should decide what simplification is necessary and
do the solving.  Do you have an example of something you want Maxima
to solve that it won't?

> The truth, it seems, is that Maxima cannot solve

Ah, here's an example.  Indeed, Maxima doesn't solve it.  Does Maple?
Does Mathematica?  What results do they give?

So you don't work for Mathematica, then.

Is this happening when you use xmaxima?  If I recall correctly, that is
a know bug with xmaxima in 5.6.  There was some discussion about it in
the archives.  That should be fixed in CVS.

Don't worry about reporting bugs - we need feedback.  In this case, you
have already contributed by showing us issues we need to address in the
documentation, with the cases you have already mentioned that turned
out to work.

> the community shouldn't reject RFE and bug reports on the basis that

I agree.  We are in transition at the moment - the original maintainer
has passed away and we are not even sure who will be doing primary
development or how we want to handle it yet.  Given a little time,
things may settle down into more traditional project form.

Don't know about maple, but mathematica gives x=-Log[1/c]/(a-b), while
warning that inverse functions are being used and some solutions may
not be found.  
Is there any way we could make Maxima assume a not equal to b, and have
it work it under those conditions?

I think what we've got is a couple different positions on what
assumptions should be made by default.  That's a hard question,
and depends on the problem it's used for.  Maybe what we 
could do is to define a package "BasicAssumptions" or something
like that which would eliminate some of the initially confusing 
stuff, and then people could load that and get more the behavior 
they expect?

Try assume(a>b)   or maybe even assume(a#b).  I don't know if solve
uses that database though.

Computer algebra systems can do rote calculations quite accurately,
even if they would require large amounts of paper, pencil, and time,
if done the traditional way. If all you have are toy problems,
and especially if your input/output overhead like slow typing 
is considerable, then pencil and paper may be best.

But the real problem is that you expect computers to know
what is in your mind, and/or to follow instructions that are
vague or non-existent, as pointed out by Jay.

In fact, most computer algebra systems solve a*x+b=0 for x=-b/a
when a more correct answer is  x=-b/a if a is not zero.

It is hard to know how accurate you are at calculation, but
the chance that one of these programs will make a blunder in
the middle of a long computation --- much too long to check by
hand --- is not zero. 

I dug out of my files an old problem that has been examined in
the literature and is no stranger to the bug lists of Macsyma, Maple,
Mathematica.  It dates back to 1989 if not earlier, and I think
may even have come out of a calculus textbook.

Integrate 1/sqrt(2-2*cos(x))   from x=-pi/2  to pi/2 .

Mathematica 4.1, without any warnings, gives a certain expression,
\!\(2\ Log[4] - 2\ Log[Cos[\[Pi]\/8]] + 2\ Log[Sin[\[Pi]\/8]]\)
which N[%] evaluates numerically to give 1.00984

Maxima 5.6 returns the integral unevaluated.
Macsyma (commercial version) says "integral is divergent"
Maple 7  says  infinity.
Ten years ago these systems got other (wrong) answers.
(The integral is divergent, I believe).

Does this mean that Maple is always right even when
Mathematica is wrong?  I doubt it, but I haven't played
that much with Maple 7.

While it is possible to argue that "not complete as possible"
and "wrong"  are different, my guess is that the analysis done
on the singularities of the integral in Mathematica was, as you say,
 not as complete as possible.  The next step in
the solution resulted in an answer that was totally wrong. Thus
the distinction between incomplete and wrong evaporates
when you use the incomplete results in the next step.  Since
these computer algebra systems are supposed to be used
for long chains of calculations in which humans do not
(cannot) check each result, correctness of the highest
order is important.

Well, since GCL won't work, I've been trying clisp.  It will run
through the whole compile, with one change, excpet at the end, where it
gives the error:  *** - EVAL: the function SAVEMEM is undefined.  Can
someone give me a hint as to what I'm doing wrong?

No. Now that you said it, I see that there's *three* different
tutorials.
	maxima-5.6/intro.html
	maxima-5.6/doc/intromax.html
	maxima-5.6/info/maxima-primer.tex

Only one of those should probably be left, after one of them
will be complete enough so that it includes the all others.

And, there should definitely be a master index for documentation,
that points to all different pieces of documentation.
It seems that the situation now is so that there are many
small overlapping pieces of documentation.

I agree pretty much to everything you say. I don't accept the
reasoning of some people on the list, althought I suspect I
somewhat understand their views.

What you want from Maxima, is to solve simple one-line equations,
or maybe to teach your students how to solve them with a CAS.

What Mr. Fateman expects a computer algebra to do, is not to teach
students how to do things with a CAS that every mathematician
could do by hand in a minute or two. I believe he considers
Maxima to be a tool for solving deep and large engineering
or mathematical problems. For such a thing a single (althought)
powerful "solve" function would not help much, because one
needs to write large amount of custom Maxima programs anyway to solve
the problem.

For a student, the aid from a CAS is to help solving equations
what the student couldn't do by hand. For Mr. Fateman, the
purpose of a CAS is different--I'm sure he could solve all
the equations by hand what any CAS system can--but to do the
handling of large systems automatically to reduce the amount of
hand work.

I also believe that the marketing forces have driven the abilities
of Mathematica and Maple to the first direction, while the
non-commercial efforts of engineers and mathematicians have driven
the power of Macsyma in to the other direction.

That said, I really hope that Maxima would be suitable for your work.
I'm a novice user and can't judge that, but Maxima has helped me
to solve many even simple problems.

I installed maxima-5.6 with clisp-2000-03-06 on SuSE 7.1 for PPC.
I made maxima at maxima-5.6/src directory via the following steps;

1. (load "compile-clisp.lisp")
2. (compile-maxima)
3. (load "init_max1.lisp")
4. (save-maxima)

The last line generate the Memory image, maxima-clisp.mem. 
I don't get such error message. What is your environment?

Good day,


As someone was pointing out to me, if Maxima standpoint is to give all 
solutions or none, then what the h*ll is it doing in this example...


(C44) solve(sin(x)=b,x);


SOLVE is using arc-trig functions to get a solution.
Some solutions will be lost.
(D44)                            [x = ASIN(b)]
(C45)


Why won't it do the same thing for exp(a * x) = C * exp(b *x) ?

What's the philosophy here?


Anyhow, I like better these arguments of yours... While I'm too lazy to 
investigate your integral this morning, I got that far...


(C24) f(x):= integrate(1/sqrt(2-2*cos(x)),x);

                                              1
(D24)              f(x) := INTEGRATE(------------------, x)
                                      SQRT(2 - 2 COS(x))
(C25) f(x);

                                    ABS(COS(x) + 1)
(D25)                      - ASINH(---------------)
                                      ABS(SIN(x))

Which is quite satisfying this early in the morning. My brain isn't 
working but, using argument likes ....

integrate(1/sqrt(2-2*cos(x)),x,0+0.0001,%PI/2-0.0001);

Seem to lead to the conclusion that it blows up (BTW, I'm sure it is a 
very easy problem). It would seem like at zero, I get f(0) = 
-asinh(Infinity) = -Infinity. I have no problem at PI/2. It would seem 
like the integral is actual infinity.

Again, we are very early in the morning, but wouldn't Maple's answer be 
correct? Why do you say it is wrong? It seems to me like the integral 
does exist... (correct me if I'm saying something foolish). If 
Mathematica is saying something foolish here... that's Mathematica's 
problem. Sure, I better get no answer than a wrong answer, but is Maple 
getting it wrong? We would also need to check on a recent version of 
Mathematica (we can't go back in time here). BTW this says nothing about 
solving exp(a * x) = C * exp(b *x) where, again, Maple gave a correct 
(in not complete) solution.

To be clear, I'm now considering using Maxima for my research, assuming 
I can get a decent user interface working (it is not all that bad, but 
in 2001, I've come to expect a bit more). So I'm at least partially in 
agreement with you. But it would still seem to me like Maxima has few 
tricks to learn.

Q: is there a way to make sure the output is in "Maxima". I know how to 
get tex output... what about Maxima outputs so I can cut and paste?

Thanks!

Did you try Texmacs? How about xmaxima?  symaxx2? these and the maxima 
mode for emacs/xemacs are the only user interfaces I know about.

It is.  Using Taylor expansion one sees that the intergrand behaves
like 1/sqrt(2-2(1-x*x/2+...)) = 1/x near 0.

May I ask you to think about your citation mode?  Probably most
readers (but at least myself) would prefer if you cited the necessary
parts of messages first (including the name of their author).

Thank you,

I suppose it depends on what is meant by ASIN.

Maybe one or the other is a bug.

Yes.  You (or someone else) asked for examples of when these programs
  gave wrong answers on calculus problems.  The first one I came
up with broke Mathematica.  I assure you that there are examples
to break the other programs.


 Sure, I better get no answer than a wrong answer, but is Maple

This is the latest version of Mathematica.  If you look on the
internet, there is a mathgroup archive with probably hundreds of
integration bugs on older versions. This bug remains from an old
version.

The Maxima program probably has all integration bugs that have
been reported and fixed in the last 20 years in the Macsyma code.
I don't know how many that might be, but considerable work on
detection of singularities may have been done by Macsyma Inc, and
lost.

BTW this says nothing about

The correct behavior of a program on one input does not usually
mean the program is free of bugs.

Ah! Thanks C Y (what is your name btw???) Now! Here's an answer I like!

I didn't investigate further as to why I get unattended processes. I 
used both maxima and xmaxima (I actually prefer maxima) over several 
days and it took me a while to realize that my box was slowing down.

I could investigate further if you want.

When is the next release for maxima planned? Should I get the CVS or 
wait for a release?

Do we have a bug reporting tool? A support request tool? I'd much rather 
file reports formally then go arguing on a mailing list!

First try the latest CVS version - the odds are this
(http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2001/000151.html) is what
you are running into.  We should probably put out 5.6.1 or something
with that fix.

I'd get the CVS release.  There are no concrete plans for a next
release that I am aware of - we need to get organized first.

Not yet - everything's pretty much on the list at the moment.  There is
a sourceforge site we are considering using which might be a good place
for a lot of that.  The current owner of the site has expressed
willingness to host some of this type of activity there - in fact it
was originally intended as a discussion site - and we may decide to
start using those resources for things like bug reports.  First,
though, we need to have a development team to deal with them. :-)

Good day,

On other mailing lists, it is stricly forbidden to quote first and then 
answer on the basis that if one is following the discussion, he has to 
read twice and possibly more every post. I also have the "quote after" 
rule in my Netiquette book at home. I wouldn't mind switching for this 
mailing list, but I'm not sure it is so obviously better to quote after. 
It all depends on how you read your mail. If you jump from one message 
to the other without following the thread, then quoting before is 
clearly better, if you read all of the thread starting from the first 
post, then quoting after seems much better.

Right.  As is it is very confusing for new users.  I've looked over the
primer and intromax.html quickly (more detailed reads will have to wait
till after class) and both contain much good information.  Probably the
primer is the best place to start.  One point - we probably need to
distinguish between primer (quick intro) and user manual (more in
depth, thorough instructions.)  We should decide what we want in each,
how much overlap their should be, and how to structure them.  I'll look
at some of the Mathematica stuff we've got lying around and see if I
can get any good ideas on how to (or maybe how not to) structure this
stuff - I would encourage everyone to brainstorm and let's see what we
can come up with.

Subject: [Maxima] More on Maxima vs Maple
Message-ID: <3BBC86E1.70000@ondelette.com>

Good day Ray,

My discussion on simplifying equations had to do with the fact that some 
people were arguing that I was to be responsible for doing factor, 
expand and so on until Maxima could solve whatever problem I submit.

I claim that if both Mathematica and Maple can solve correctly a given 
problem without me having to use factor, expand and so on... then I just 
found a limitation of Maxima. A limitation that should be put on a "to 
do list" or "request for enhancement list". Instead, I was told I didn't 
understand computer algebra by some (or at least, it was implied). I 
feel that I understand computer algebra as well as any user should.

Yes. They both solve it properly. Maxima chokes on it. It won't choke on

exp(a * x) /exp(b * x) = C

however. I say that Maxima could be improved here.

Yes. It has been implied by some individual that I should be expected to 
play around with an equation like "exp(a * x) = C * exp(b * x)" before 
Maxima can solve it. I've been told that I should chart my solution 
before asking Maxima to solve it. Basically, instead of saying "Maxima 
is limited here and we should probably see if someone can fix that", 
I've been told that I didn't know how to use Computer Algebra. I disagree.

I'm not blaming anyone, I'm trying to push the community around so that 
we have a nice process where we don't go assuming that Maxima 
necessarily does the right thing all the time. I'm trying to make sure 
that my voice is heard. I think I managed to do that quite well and I'm 
happy. ;-)

I was being cynical. I was trying to make a point about some people just 
dismissing my criticism right off.

Out of 4 problems I submitted to the community (problems I took out of a 
Maple class I'm teaching), it turns out that Maxima can solve quite well 
2 of them (through tricks I people gave me). Both Mathematica and Maple 
can solve all 4 problems. I only kept one problem (the exp one), because 
I'm convinced Maxima should be able to solve it.

You must realize that at first, Maxima failed to solve the 4 problems I 
copied over from my Maple sheet. It was very disappointing to get a 
score of zero. Now, Maxima gets a score of 50%. That's way up thanks to 
the community!

Now, I'm only trying to propose that Maxima should aim for the 100% 
score. That is, it should do as well as commercial tools.

Hi Dave,

Yes, I guess we don't agree. However, given that other tools can do what 
I expect them to do, I know that my expectations are realistic from a 
computer algebra system.

Whether or not it is a much needed feature is open for debate, but 
whether or not it is possible isn't.

I think it's right,at least reasonable,now.
But for the first time I happend to encounter that,
I was surprised.

Maybe the philosophy is that if terams is increased,example
solve(x^a-c*x^b-d*x^e,x),even if a,b,e are positive interger,
x^a-c*x^b-d*x^e=0 has too many patterns for equation.
Not like as x^3-a*x+b=0,x^a-c*x^b-d*x^e has not a single standard
pattern,so If we intend to solve with symbolic manipulation,we must
classify in some or other case.
If we know well the problem which we want to solve,that efforts are
no use,I think.

No need - this is almost certainly the problem already mentioned on the
list.  If it pops up in CVS, then we need to start tracking it down,
but from the behavior you've described it's almost certainly the known
error.
 
> When is the next release for maxima planned? Should I get the CVS or

For now I'd say get CVS - we haven't gotten organized enough to know
what our time table looks like for releases.  Although maybe we should
put out 5.6.1 or something so we don't get a zillion requests to fix
the xmaxima thing.

Right now the mailing list is about it - we may be able to shift some
of that kind of stuff to sourceforge, which has resources for bug
tracking and places for people to enter support requests.  We probably
need to figure that out fairly soon, but it's kind of tough since right
now we don't even know for sure who is doing what.

You'll find the explanation in the documentation for the solve
command, DESCRIBE(SOLVE);

It says that SOLVE deals with equations of the form P(F(X))=C where P
is a polynomial (quadratic, cubic, etc) and F is an invertible
function.  The equations exp(a*x)=C*exp(b*x) and a^x = b^x do not fall
into that class, hence it does not attempt to solve them.

Ah! Now, here's an answer I like!

Now, all you need to do is have an algorithm to try to transform 
equations into the P(F(X))=C format!

RJF: 
I'm not sure I mentioned it previously, but the commercial Macsyma
solves this without any fuss, providing [x=-log(c)/(b-a)].

Of course if C= -1, then Macsyma provides i*pi/(b-a), but
if I understand Daniel's preferences, he would like it to
return "no solutions exist" in this case.

How hard would it be to change Maxima?  Probably not so
hard. My guess is that what you need is a "heuristic program"
that attempts to collect all occurrences of the unknown on
one side. A program to do this, and other
similar things, called PRESS, was written in Prolog by
some distinguished researchers in Artificial Intelligence
The following paper is a review of Press (by Fateman), perhaps
more of an attack than a review:) 
followed by a defense of PRESS (by Bundy, O'Keefe, Sterling).
followed by a rejoinder by Fateman, in one case.


See 
@Article{Fateman:1988:CSS,
  author =       "Richard Fateman and Alan Bundy and Richard O'Keefe and
                 Leon Sterling",
  title =        "Commentary on: solving symbolic equations with
                 {PRESS}",
  journal =      j-SIGSAM,
  volume =       "22",
  number =       "2",
  pages =        "27--40",
  month =        apr,
  year =         "1988",}

Some comments...

PRESS solves this equation:
cos(x) +cos(3*x) +cos(5*x)=0.
It gets arccos(0)/3 and arccos(-1/2)/2, which are probably simplified to pi/6
and pi/3
Macsyma gets 10 not necessarily distinct solutions to this.
Like 4*pi*(n-1)/2, 4*pi(n+1)/2, pi*(12*n+5)/6  etc..
What would you like here?


PRESS also solves exp(3*x)-4*exp(x)+3*exp(-x)=0, giving
log(sqrt(3), 0, log(-1), log(-sqrt(3)).
Two of these are wrong.
Macsyma gives 4 parameterized solution sets.

I say "Can PRESS combine the merits of searching/matching with
mathematical methods?  Probably by discarding most of PRESS
and adding some additional heuristics to any of the well-known systems: but
generally at the risk of introducing extraneous roots (difficult to
check), or possibly missing roots."


I just noticed that I wrote a paper (10 years ago) after this
paper of 1988, called Notes on Computer Systems for Solving
Symbolic Equations.   I re-ran it through tex and it lives as
a pdf file... http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/solving.pdf

It was never published (until now.)

Ideally, Richard, I'd like Maxima to allow be to switch "Complex ON" or 
"Complex OFF".

This being said, if it is too hard, I would rather have the complex 
solutions given to me than nothing. My preference though would be to be 
able to turn complex numbers on or off.

Why? Because I don't want maxima to find an answer to "exp(x) = -1". I 
want Maxima to say that there are no real solutions. Then, if I enable 
complex numbers, it could give me something else.

I'm not algebra specialist, but it seems to me that a good computer 
algebra system should be able to work with various rings: complex, 
real... and more?

Surely, we cannot expect Maxima to support all rings, but complex and 
reals seem like two reasonable sets to support!

Am I crazy in requesting such a feature???

Well yes---but I think that QuickStart could be, for example, first
chapter in User Manual. That is, there should be as little "books"
to read as possible, even if a bit thicker. That way a document
wouldn't go accidently unnoticed for a new user.

The Reference Manual and User Manual could be probably two different
things.

Other tools (Maple?) have a "student" package with settings and
procedures that make them more suitable for students exploring maths
by computer. I think such a package could be written for Maxima as
well, preferably by a person who wants to use Maxima for teaching.

Good day Ole,

Yes, I suppose. This being said however, I'm not using any "student 
package". When I say that "solve(exp(a*x)=c*(exp(b*x), x)" works with 
other tools, it does. Period. You don't need a student package. I'm not 
sure why Maxima would like to use such a "student package". It could 
just solve the equation the best it can, indicating, possibly, that it 
didn't work out all cases and that it is assuming real numbers throughout.

Good day Richard,

Then, let's produce the complex solutions. End of story.

For exp(a * x) = c * exp(b * x), let's printout all possible solutions 
if finding only the real solutions (like some other tools do) is a bad idea.

But then, if in turn, I don't want people to use that excuse later to 
say "wait! maxima can't solve with exp because exp is not one-to-one!".

Is there a way to have apropos functioning? I'm using maxima_5.6-12.deb.
Or, if it broken, is there a way to find the information where the manual 
refers to apropos ("Try APROPOS(SOLVE) for the switches which affect SOLVE.")?

No brainstorm, just a breeze:

To me the real problem is that there seems to be such a lot of wrong 
information and information I plainly can't understand (possibly because it's 
based on wrong information). I try to learn to use Maxima (btw without trying 
to do things in lisp, which seems to be one of my problems), I try not to 
complain (it took me quite some time to more or less understand Mathematica, 
and there was an excellent manual), but I have to say it's frustrating 
sometimes. In my feeling the manual was written for a very different piece of 
software, and anyway ias soon as you make a mistake you are sent to lisp. To 
give one (my last) example: The description of the function radcan. At least 
my version of maxima doesn't care at all if radexpand is true or not, those 
examples (RADCAN(SQRT(1-X)) and RADCAN(SQRT(X^2-2*X+1))) give their 
(reasonable) answers independent of what I do with radexpand.

Oh now! That's so rhetorical!

Let us give all roots if we can (including complexe ones). That's fine 
by me. Let just never use the complex numbers as an excuse for *not*
solving a problem! That's how it all started. I was told Maxima could
not solve problems with "exp" in it because "exp" wasn't one-to-one. If 
working with complex numbers mean that we cannot solve some easy and 
certainly solvable equation, please, let not use them. If, on the other 
hand, you propose we use complex numbers in such a way as to give as 
many solutions as possible, then I'm applauding!

I have no intention of building anything around anything.

My point is that I don't think we need a student edition. I get
the feeling that either someone wasn't taking me seriously or else
thought I was having fun.


There are things that make sense. Like the fact that SCSIMP doesn't 
simplify sin(x) ^2 + cos(x) ^2 to 1 because there is another function 
for it. It makes sense to me. The fact that you have various switches 
that you can turn on and off. That makes sense. It makes using the 
software more difficult, but it makes sense.

However, I will refuse to buy the argument going around : "Maxima is for 
real men and real men solve and simplify manually". This will never fly 
with me.

Subject: [Maxima] Re: What should "solving" really mean, some literature.
Message-ID: <3BBF6E50.4050308@home.com>

I have a suggestion that may require alot of programming, but it is a 
feature that I have always wanted in a CAS but never seen.

When solving an equation such as

exp(1) = exp(x) for x

return an infinite set of solutions

x = {1 + 2*k*pi*i} | k is an integer

so everytime this happens, there would be a k1, k2, k3 ... or perhaps 
just saying int1, int2, ... would be better.

And then just do calculations on the set as normal. I am thinking that 
when I work in the complex plane, this is how I would do it, and my 
understanding of CAS is that it seems possible. The only problem I can 
see is to make Maxima understand that something like int1 + int2 could 
be simplified to int3

And people that only want real solutions, then there could be a flag so 
the integer will be assumed to be zero.

I also had one other feature that I have always wanted, and that is when 
you try to do something funny like integrate x^p for x, instead of 
having to give information about p, just return a piece wise function 
for different values of p

This is a serious problem, addressed in part by a masters project
done under my direction by Neil Soiffer circa 1980.  Essentially,
find the minimum number of "arbitrary constants" in a rational
expression of several variables that maintains the same amount of 
arbitrariness.  The
restriction to rational functions makes it solvable by resultants,
but the more general problem has not been addressed, as far as I know.

This would not guarantee realness; e.g.  solve (sin(i*x)=y, x).

This also is something I've worried about, but the general problem
is to keep the pieces going through some more calculations without
getting an enormous blow-up in complexity.  Simplifying geometric
constraints is needed to cut back on this, and it is tough.
I believe a masters' project by Sam Dooley looked at making
a simplifier work with this approach.  Didn't get too far
though.

anyone help me out with a pointer or workaround?

I started to play around with maxima, and there are strange things that

Why's that? The manual says

     In the case where E is a
     polynomial in some function of the variable to be solved for, say
     F(X), then it is first solved for F(X) (call the result C), then
     the equation F(X)=C can be solved for X provided the inverse of
     the function F is known.
so why wouldn't maxima do in C4 what it did in C3?

Hi, Chris,
I have seen something like that, I think it was Reduce. (There is a demo 
version).

But to me it wasn't that impressive, it's more like a data base with some 
extra information, I bet if you ask for %I^%I the answer will be (like in 
maxima and in Mathematica) exp(-Pi/2) (try polarform(%I^%I)).

And if you where a CAS, what would you do with exp(x)=sin(x)? I can't see 
another way of finding the real solutions by some Newton + the insight that 
those solutions are fairly close to -n*Pi. And if it comes to complex 
solutions (up to now I found one,  around 0.36270205612105 + i* 
1.133745919413753); I confess I learned a lot about maxima, that's why I'm 
trying to solve it, but I can't see a solver able to do it without help. 

By the way, this complex solution produced a lot of strange behaviour, but 
I'll put that in another mail.

Message-ID: <4nitdqyuj1.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

I'd like to make maxima's elliptic functions and integrals consistent
with Macsyma's version.

If you have access to Macsyma, could you tell me how sn is defined?
Is it sn(u,m) or sn(u,k)?  How about the elliptic integrals?  Is it
F(phi\alpha) or F(phi|m)?  Is it E(phi\alpha), E(phi|m), or E(u|m)?

Thanks,

Message-ID: <20011008212509.25992.qmail@web12202.mail.yahoo.com>

Here's the problem - I want to find the Laplacian in polar coordinates,
knowing it in cartesian.  So I set up the following:

(C1) DEPENDS([U],[rho,theta,phi],[rho,theta,phi],[x,y,z])$

(C2) diff(U,x,2)+diff(U,y,2)+diff(U,z,2);


Part of what I got is:

	       2	        2		   2
     dtheta  dtheta   d U     drho     d U	 dphi	  d U
(D2) ------ (------ ------- + ---- ----------- + ---- -----------)
       dz      dz	  2    dz  drho dtheta	  dz  dphi dtheta
		    dtheta

		     2		      2			 2
   dtheta  dtheta   d U	    drho     d U       dphi     d U
 + ------ (------ ------- + ---- ----------- + ---- -----------)
     dy	     dy	        2    dy	 drho dtheta    dy  dphi dtheta
		  dtheta


Now I want to define rho, theta and phi and evalutate this thing, but
when I do that it thinks I want to take some bizarre derivative of U
and spits back an error.  Is there any way to define theta and friends,
evaluate the expression above, and not have it try to do the U
derivatives?  ev seems to be nonspecific, and I can't come up with any
other bright ideas.  I could of course define thetaprime and use subst,
but that is a long slow process.  Is there some way to handle this kind
of problem?

Well, it was pointed out to me that apropos can provide more

Message-ID: <20011010224222.B347C2FEAE@joseph.doink.com>

Hi,

    Can anyone out there give me some pointers on building gcl & 
    maxima on a sparc64 (Ultra 10) and solaris2.8 machine?

    I used "sparc-sun-solaris2" as an argument to configure.
    Later on in my make log I see that a sub-configure decides
    that

checking host system type... sparcv9-sun-solaris2.8
checking target system type... sparcv9-sun-solaris2.8
checking build system type... sparcv9-sun-solaris2.8

    Then later the gmp/mpn stuff symlinks like so

linking ./mpn/sparc32/add_n.asm to mpn/add_n.asm
linking ./mpn/sparc32/sub_n.asm to mpn/sub_n.asm
linking ./mpn/sparc32/v9/mul_1.asm to mpn/mul_1.asm
linking ./mpn/sparc32/v9/addmul_1.asm to mpn/addmul_1.asm

linking ./mpn/sparc32/lshift.asm to mpn/lshift.asm
linking ./mpn/sparc32/rshift.asm to mpn/rshift.asm
[lots of generic linking left out here]

    Then when the compiling starts, it doesn't get very far at
    all before blowing up like this

m4 -DPIC -DOPERATION_mul_1 mul_1.asm >tmp-mul_1.s
/bin/sh ../libtool --mode=compile /tools/gcc/bin/gcc -c -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I.  -I.. -I.. -DOPERATION_mul_1    -g -O2 tmp-mul_1.s -o mul_1.lo

[ad nauseum]

    I'd like to get this to compile, either by being smart
    somehow (that where you come in!), or by tricking configure
    into building a compatible system.

    Can you help me out here please?

    Oh yeah, I'm trying to do this with gcc version 2.9.

    Thanks much....

Subject: [Maxima] web maxima?
Message-ID: <200110111343.f9BDh4C54279@convex.cs.unb.ca>

There has been some discussion lately of pretty front ends to maxima.
Although I fall in the Emacs camp for my own use, it occured to me 
that what could be very useful would be the ability to generate
interactive web pages.  One system that can do this is Cinderalla
(www.cinderella.de).  Cinderella works be generating a java applet 
containing the run time. 

I guess the simplest option would be to generate math-ml pages with 
cgi-scripts back to some brave host willing to run maxima code.

On the other hand, since there exist a lisp systems (well, the
ones I found are scheme. I'm too ignorant to know if that is
fatal) that target java, a more ambitious project may be
possible.

Subject: [Maxima] More accurate gamma
Message-ID: <4n7ku25lrc.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

While playing around with some elliptic integrals, I needed to
evaluate some gamma functions.  The numerical gamma functions included
with maxima seem to have about 5-6 digits of accuracy.

I've included an updated version that is supposed to accurate to about
15 digits and is valid for the entire complex plane.  (The current
code doesn't support numerically evaluating the gamma function at
complex values.)

To use this, just replace gammafloat in csimp2 with the following
code.  You can probably also delete gamma and do-gammafloat in
csimp2.lisp.

I don't know what you really have in mind "generating interactive
web pages".  Can you write out a scenario or two of what
you would want?

There are several free lisp packages to do server processes,
including generating html.
MathML is not universally understood by browsers, but even
so, it hardly solves the important communication problems. If it
did, you wouldn't need Java.
If you need Java, you can transmit math by many more
efficient and effective techniques, assuming your goal
is to communicate betweeen a single front end and a single
back end.
   There may be some help if you can re-use mathml display code.

I'm afraid the idea is still a little half baked. 

The the idea is more allow people to evaluate some simple expressions,
without downloading and installing software. On the other hand
because even the simplest computations can explode, I don't really 
want to run them on the web server.

One scenario: I have a catalog of families of polytopes:
 ( one page is here.
 http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/PolytopeBase/catalog/dwarfcube.html ).

These integrate bibliographic info with code (currently perl) to
generate descriptions of the polytopes.  Currently in order to
experiment (i.e. what does the matrix of coefficients look like, or
let me generate this polytope and feed it to my program), people have
to download some perl and possibly install perl.  I would like to make
the process more painless, have some form fields on the web page that
the users can fill in, and have the data generated within their
browser.

Maxima is overkill for the computations needed here (Basically big
integers, rationals are needed).

Upon reflection, I suppose there are two separate issues. One is a
kind of notebook front-end, runnable from within a web browser.  The
other is a maxima backend running as a java applet.  Both of these are
probably (overly?) ambitious projects.

1. It is certainly possible to set up maxima on a server
so that anyone can connect
to it from a web browser and type in a command or several commands.
This is a hour or two's work for someone familiar with
maxima and webservers in lisp.  (unfortunately, not a lot of
people in this group.)
2. Running different users in the same maxima is probably a
bad idea, so you end up running a separate process for each
user, at least to simplify things.
3. Keeping some user from taking over your machine can
probably be prevented by limiting the CPU time.  Keeping some
user from trashing your machine by doing file I/O requires
some thought.

Downloading all of maxima to a user when people routinely have
40 gigabyte disks on their PCs may not be such a bad idea.


The real win for a "web server maxima"  may be if it is going to
be updated daily with the latest mathematical discoveries,
will always be run on the fastest machine in the world, and
has access to all the software that you can't afford to
buy for your home.
Or some mixture of those attributes.

Have you considered to integrate pari in maxima? As far as I know they have a 
lot of special functions (and other goodies) implemented with very fast and 
accurate code and with any precision you could wish and it's free.

Good idea, and it's GPL too so the license is compatible with maxima.

However, it looks like it's in C.  Doing a foreign function interface
to it may not be easy.  And certainly not portable.

But this would be very nice to have....

What about a pipe style process, like we were talking about earlier for
a front end?  Start up a pari session, and have maxima pipe requests to
it, and get responses?  That would probably require some syntax
manipulation, but maxima can already export to TeX and there is also a
program written to export content mathml by Dr. Barton Willis of the
University of Nebraska at Kearney, so I'm sure exporting to pari syntax
could be managed. Could that work?

Seems like you are assuming a model that
is at least as hard as foreign functions, namely
unix style pipes.
  Pipes are way too fragile.  Do you mean 
that you would compute the value of a gamma function
by writing a character string to a pipe, and
then read the answer?
  Not only would this be extraordinarily slow,
but you would have to deal with out-of-pipe
communications like  "floating point overflow".

Foreign function interface would, in my
opinion, require less effort and be much
more effective.  And yes, it too would have
to be done on a platform by platform basis.
(Though I suspect all versions of GCL would
have the same FFI.)

It's not a long time back when Pari *was* integrated with Maxima
(the code might still be there, or maybe not) but Maxima used
Pari code only for arbitrary precision computations.
A while back our yearned Mr. Schelter integrated gmp code
in Maxima which is (he said) much faster, although gmp
doesn't have the goodies that Pari does.

My answer is that

Nice!  Thanks!  About the bug in trigsimp.lisp - is there a reason we
have two different packages for this kind of stuff?  I recall that when
I asked the question about grad, vect.mc had to be used and even then a
couple changes were needed.  What's the history behind these different
packages?

Guys, is anyone else of the opinion that we should maybe release maxima
5.6.1 with the fix for the xmaxima problem and a couple fixes sent in
by people over the past few months?

Also, we probably need to make a decision about how we are going to
handle development and releases and such.  If we lose too much momentum
things might never get organized.  Anyone have any ideas on how to make
this decision?

Either
1.  Give some people write-access to the CVS files in U Texas.
2.  Move them to the maxima sourceforge site and give selected people
    write-access to those files.
3.  Some other solution.

To get things rolling, I volunteer to test patches, etc, and to commit
them to CVS if people feel I'm so qualified.  I do not, however, want
to take the responsibility of a "release", except, perhaps, bundling
up the files into a tar file and waving a magic wand over it,

    Since Maxima is moving from one person being in charge of
    most things to something more distributed, I suggest that we
    do a few things before answering the question.

    - Make an educated guess at the number of people with coding
      skills that would contribute to development.  Did anyone
      make count last time the questions went out?

    - Make an educated guess at the number of people with
      software development administration skills that would
      contribute to development.  I don't recall this skill-set
      being addressed here before.

    - Make an educated guess at the number of people that could
      test, package, distribute, document.

    - Find another nicely running open source project of about
      the same size, and see what they're doing that works, then
      copy everything that's applicable.

    I'd like to just answer the question, but I'm on a very small
    development team (only four of us, two as administrators, all
    four as developers) which runs through sourceforge.  I don't
    know that our model is applicable, though it might be if the
    number of developers, administrators, and other contributors
    turns out to be that small.

    Comments?

OK, I've gone back through the archives and tried to list who said they
were interested in doing what.  A ? indicates that I'm not sure if they
are wanting to be active coders, but have expressed interest in the
coding phase and have useful information/code to contribute.  Sorry if
I missed anyone, or put anything down wrong.

We aren't sure what size we are yet, so that question is a bit tough. 
Hopefully this thread will resolve some of those questions.

        Yes that, and deciding what goes into the stable releases
        and into the development releases.  From what I've seen,
        projects with a dedicated skilled leader succeed, and
        others are much less successful.  Maybe that's a truism?

        It seems possible that the project could also succeed if
        we could get consensus on what we're going to do, when
        to do it, how to decide when it's done & good enough for
        a certain class of release, and then how/when to repeat
        this.  Would you call that a charter & plan?

	What were there 20-25 people on your list?  Some will

	I'm back.  Later I'll be off for a bit again.

As pointed to me by willib at unk.edu, the Bessel functions aren't very
accurate either.  I looked around and see that erf isn't that good
either.

I have replacements for these, if anyone is interested.  They're Lisp
versions of the Fortran code in TOMS 715, converted via f2cl.  I've
tested these and they're accurate to about within 2-3 bits for the
most part, according to the tests included in TOMS 715.

Perhaps they'll get added someday, or someone will hook up Pari to
maxima again.

Usually that leader is the project founder - since it's his/
her project, they have a voice of authority.

That also works, but I think what would be needed here is 
a hybrid - a core group with skills and high standards who
work on the core system and also evaluate packages people
write to see if they are good enough to include, and a sort
of second tier which either picks a task from a wishlist we
put togeather, or starts their own effort as they 
choose, and the core group can evaluate it and include it 
when it reaches high enough quality.  

Specifically, we have a couple people who are good lisp 
coders and experienced with computer algebra - they should
probably be the only ones with CVS write access.  

Here's the key question - who out there feels comfortable
being in the position of having CVS write access and being
a key developer?  We need to have someone step forward.  
(Or get nominated :-)

If we don't have anyone like that willing to lead, we can
of course make do - what I'd propose in that case is 
that every so often we hold a scheduled group audit of new 
code and patches, and then based on a group concensus
update the distribution.  Maybe start an IRC channel, and
then every so often meet as a group to hash out issues.

At any rate, we need to make a decision soon - we need a 
framework within which bug fixes can become part of CVS,
and a way for new efforts to be added to the distro.

Message-ID: <20011013000558.22198.qmail@web12202.mail.yahoo.com>

Two documentation points, both sort of related.

1)  I've sort of begun the process of trying to decide how to do the
User Manual, and in the process written a shell of said Manual in Lyx. 
I have tried to collect the helpful notes on compiling Maxima and
discuss the available graphical interfaces for a start, although that
isn't even a drop in the bucket, so to speak.  

With regards to the point made earlier, about having the quick start as
the first chapter, my personal opinion is that we might want to keep
that a different document.  All that information should be contained in
the manual, certainly, but the more I think about it I think we will be
better off if we have a short paper people can print, and then the
longer book-like effort as a different document.  It would make things
a little simpler, since the tone of the two works will most likely be
quite different.

2)  It would probably be very nice if we could get a history of
Macsyma/Maxima to include, just so people know where this thing
originated from and the twisted path it's taken to get here. :-)  I'm
not qualified, certainly, and I was wondering if we had anyone here who
both has lots of knowledge of the history of Macsyma and it's various
offspring and would be willing to write a history up for the User
Manual. It's kind of neat that Maxima has such a long lineage, and it
would be kind of a shame not to document it.  Maybe whoever accepts the
task can interview some of the key players in the history of this thing
and put the story togeather.  Anyone interested?

I think that that being the actual founder isn't that crucial, the
important thing is having a dedicated skilled leader as the voice of
authority.

I think this may be where Maxima ends up, but I don't think it's an
ideal situation.  In my experience, having a single leader making the
final decisions has better results than working off of a group
consensus.  There are people here who are certainly capable, although
I don't know if they'd be willing to take on the task.
So Maxima may end up being run by committee, but I don't think that
should be the first choice.

Looks like the symptom of a bug in the polynomial
greatest common divisor algorithm.  This could
be caused by a bug in the integer division algorithm
in the underlying lisp.

I think that, more than many other projects, the maxima program
lends itself to be divided into sections, with different people
taking primary responsibility for these sections.  This is not
to deny the advantage of having a single leader, but just
to say that quite a few things can be done by distributed
programmers. Coming up with a new release periodically requires
coordination and perhaps someone acting as a leader.

   Why do I say it can be divided? ...
Here's why.
  The lisp code is divided up into files, each one of which (or
perhaps a collection of a few files) defines some capabilities.
For example, numerical evaluation of special functions. Some
require the correct behavior of many other parts, but through
interfaces, often declared in the files themselves, though
not always.  (Integration is in a few files, but uses other
capabilities including simplification, rational functions,
polynomial arithmetic, etc.)  It is possible for someone to
be "in charge of integration"  to ask someone who is
"in charge of simplification"  to add a feature.


There are a number of modules that could, in principle,
be entirely replaced by new code: re-doing polynomial
arithmetic;  re-doing the display; re-doing the front-end
language parser.  Even though some of these are at the
core of the system, they act as dispatchers to other
programs.  The model, for those who have learned lisp or
scheme up to a modest level of achievement, is one of
a read-eval-print loop.  And hanging more stuff off the
eval part is always possible.

A more sophisticated view of what maxima does would have
to include the side effects of eval-ing a command to
some kind of cummulative data base of facts, definitions,
etc.

There are other portions of such a project that I
think of as entirely separate, namely the porting to
different lisps and machines.  This sometimes requires
a longitudinal look at ALL the files to fix dependencies
of some sort.  It should not require such an effort,
but in reality, recompiling 200 files or so on a new
machine/host system ordinarily finds "something".

This is what I found at the home page of cmucl:

#CMUCL: a high-performance, free Common Lisp implementation 
#. . . 
#Here is a summary of its main features: 
#. . .
#a foreign function interface which allows interfacing with C code and system 
#libraries, including shared libraries on most platforms, and direct access 
#to Unix system calls. 

And from the pari home page I get:

#PARI-GP is a software package for computer-aided number theory. It consists 
#of a C library, libpari (with optional assembler cores for some popular 
#architectures) . . .

Shouldn't that be enough? I don't know about programming and interfacing and 
all that, so maybe I'm just missing the point. But to me it looks like 
maxima's strength is in manipulating formulas, maintaining a knowledge base, 
understanding context and stuff like that, and not in numerical calculations, 
graphics interface and by the way not in user interface. If I look at it as a 
kind of free Mathematica or Maple, to me it looks like a looser. But if I 
look at it as a kind of linux kernel for scientific software, it looks really 
exciting to me.

Two things which occurred to me:

1. If the underlying lisp, that is gcl, is also buggy, I would prefer someone 
changed maxima to a lisp which is maintained by some established group, so 
those problems are taken care of otherwhere.

2. If it is the underlying lisp, does this explain the (C6) example of mine 
also? I repeated this example something like 20 times, and one answer 
(exactly one answer that is, so no scientific evidence) after pressing Ctrl-C 
was different. The standard answer of course is 

(C1) Solve((a^2+1)*x^2+a^3*x+1=0,x);

Correctable error: Console interrupt.
Signalled by MACSYMA-TOP-LEVEL.
If continued: Type :r to resume execution, or :q to quit to top level.
Broken at SYSTEM:TERMINAL-INTERRUPT.  Type :H for Help.

but once it said

(C3) Solve((a^2+1)*x^2+a^3*x+1=0,x);

Correctable error: Console interrupt.
Signalled by PCPLUS.
If continued: Type :r to resume execution, or :q to quit to top level.

Process Maxima aborted

Does this mean anything to you?

This means that you have stopped the program during the execution of
the program "macsyma-top-level".  It was waiting for input, probably.
You hit ^c^c.

At the first ^c or maybe the second, you interrupted it
when it was inside the program during the execution of "pcplus"
which I happen to know is a program that is part of the
polynomial arithmetic package.  I think it is defined in
file rat3a.

But you probably hit another ^c or two, so instead of resuming
the computation or quitting to top level, you killed the process.
This is not what you wanted, probably.  And it may be possible
to get GCL or whatever lisp you are using to do something else.

I am not an expert on these various lisps.  I almost always
used Allegro CL, although I also have a "prepackaged" maxima
for windows which presumably has GCL underneath.

Subject: [Maxima] gmp vs mp ?
Message-ID: <3BC9564C.72A60350@mail.ru>

Last days I was busy by building and testing GCL and Maxima on
i86 Linux.
And I've got some strange results concerning gmp vs mp
performance.
It was stated that gmp should be faster than mp but my
observations give
exactly opposite result. Some figures:

Maxima 5.6 last CVS version + GCL 2.3.8beta3 (mp):

expand((x+y+z)^300)$                99.8 sec
ratsimp((x+y+z)^300)$                11.8 sec

Maxima 5.6 last CVS version + GCL 2.4.0 (gmp):

expand((x+y+z)^300)$                239.2 sec
ratsimp((x+y+z)^300)$                18.7 sec

In all other tests gmp is always slower although
the difference ranges from few percent up to two times.

Any ideas?

This isn't a fix for the solve bug,

(C4) SOLVE((a^2+1)*x^2+a*x+a,x);
quotient is not exact
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)

but it may help somebody find it.  I believe the bug is caused by
what simpnrt returns in the function solvequad. It is the function
fullratsimp following simpnrt that never returns a value; simpnrt
appears to be okay, but fullratsimp doesn't like  what it returns.
Replacing

(DEFUN SOLVEQUAD (EXP &AUX DISCRIM A B C)
  (SETQ A (CADDR EXP))
  (SETQ B (PTERM (CDR EXP) 1.))
  (SETQ C (PTERM (CDR EXP) 0.))
  (SETQ DISCRIM (SIMPLIFY (PDIS (PPLUS (PEXPT B 2.)
                           (PMINUS (PTIMES 4. (PTIMES A C)))))))
  (SETQ B (PDIS (PMINUS B)))
  (SETQ A (PDIS (PTIMES 2. A)))
  ;; At this point, everything is back in general representation.
  (COND ((EQUAL 0. DISCRIM)
      (SOLVE3 (FULLRATSIMP `((MQUOTIENT) ,B ,A))
           (TIMES 2. MULT)))
     (T (SETQ DISCRIM (SIMPNRT DISCRIM 2.))
        (SOLVE3 (FULLRATSIMP `((MQUOTIENT) ((MPLUS) ,B ,DISCRIM) ,A))
             MULT)
        (SOLVE3 (FULLRATSIMP `((MQUOTIENT) ((MPLUS) ,B ((MMINUS) ,DISCRIM)) ,A))
             MULT))))


with

(DEFUN SOLVEQUAD (EXP &AUX DISCRIM A B C)
  (SETQ A (CADDR EXP))
  (SETQ B (PTERM (CDR EXP) 1.))
  (SETQ C (PTERM (CDR EXP) 0.))
  (SETQ DISCRIM (SIMPLIFY (PDIS (PPLUS (PEXPT B 2.)
                           (PMINUS (PTIMES 4. (PTIMES A C)))))))
  (SETQ B (PDIS (PMINUS B)))
  (SETQ A (PDIS (PTIMES 2. A)))
  ;; At this point, everything is back in general representation.
  (COND ((EQUAL 0. DISCRIM)
      (SOLVE3 (FULLRATSIMP `((MQUOTIENT) ,B ,A))
           (TIMES 2. MULT)))
     (T (SETQ DISCRIM `((mexpt) ,DISCRIM ,(rat 1 2))) ;; only change
        (SOLVE3  `((MQUOTIENT) ((MPLUS) ,B ,DISCRIM) ,A)
              MULT)
        (SOLVE3  `((MQUOTIENT) ((MPLUS) ,B ((MMINUS) ,DISCRIM)) ,A)
              MULT))))

eliminates the bug:

(C8) load("solve_crusty.lisp")$

(C9) solve((a^2+1)*x^2 + a*x+a,x);
(D9) [x = (-SQRT(-4*a^3+a^2-4*a)-a)/(2*a^2+2),
      x = (SQRT(-4*a^3+a^2-4*a)-a)/(2*a^2+2)]

My maxima is 5.6; my Lisp is GCL 2.4.0; and my OS is Redhat 6.1.

I've checked solve on Maxima 5.6 under CLISP.
Bug remains. So this isn't Lisp prolem and solve in Maxima
seems to be broken :-(

Comparing Maxima under GCL and CLISP I noticed another
strange thing. If execute sequentially
showtime:true;
   w:expand((x+y+z)^100)$
   ww:expand((x+y+z)^200)$
   www:expand((x+y+z)^300)$
I get timings
  3 sec
  15 sec
  40 sec
But if I restart Maxima and do just
  www:expand((x+y+z)^300)$
I get  100 sec ! Why timings are so diffrent?
This is GCS feature since under CLISP time is always the same.

If the only thing that has been changed is gmp version,
then it is puzzling.  You could find a better test of
pure arithmetic too. Maybe requiring integer GCDs etc.
My guess is that you are doing more garbage collection
somehow.  I don't know why maxima doesn't break out
the GC time... maybe GCl doesn't support it/  but
it is a very useful measure of whether you have enough
free storage at your disposal.

here is a possible explanation.
doing the sequence of commands, the system realizes that it
must allocate more memory, and does so several times and
does not waste too much in garbage collection.

when you restart maxima, the garbage collection new-allocation
algorithm does not realize that it is going to need a lot more
space until it has already used up many seconds.

Tuning the garbage collection algorithm can make big differences.
One reason the commercial version of macsyma is so slow
is precisely that.   for expand ((x+y+z)^200)$ the time
taken on my system is 128.5 seconds, 92 seconds in GC.
That is, the "useful" computation took 36 seconds.

If we go that way, we need to divide up the tasks into 
pieces which will be maintained.  Richard, you're almost
certainly the best qualified of any of us to handle that
and be overall coordinator - if everyone agrees, would 
you be willing to take on that role?

I made more than one change to solvequad; in addition to
replacing the simpart function call, I replaced

    (SOLVE3 (FULLRATSIMP `((MQUOTIENT) ((MPLUS) ,B ,DISCRIM) ,A)) MULT)

with
    (SOLVE3 `((MQUOTIENT) ((MPLUS) ,B ,DISCRIM) ,A)  MULT)

and made the same change to

(SOLVE3 (FULLRATSIMP `((MQUOTIENT) ((MPLUS) ,B ((MMINUS) ,DISCRIM)) ,A))
MULT))))

I don't think simpnrt is the problem.  Removing only the two calls to
fullratsimp alows maxima to solve the equation. Maybe this will help
somebody find the real bug.

I may be more qualified by previous experience to help
with lisp, but not with the various other aspects.
  I am not familiar with the Sourceforge setup and
I am frankly scared of the prospect of integrating
code written by persons of various skills into something
that works.

   In my view one of the major problems
of the 1970-1980 coding (the last done at MIT) was
that a self-appointed energetic undergraduate who thought
he was really smart and knew how to code "better"...
substantially raised the barrier to understanding the
system. He also inserted bugs because he didn't know
what some of the algorithms were supposed to do.

I am quite familiar with undergraduate projects
here at Berkeley, and getting such a project to
really work typically requires a substantial additional
effort by staff or graduate students or faculty.

If someone really wants to make something better, I
think he/she should make a proposal to this list and
let us all look at it.  The guiding principle should
probably be, "first, do no harm".

  If all or some of us think it
is a bad idea, but someone still wants to do it, all
that is needed is for the author to keep the code in
a separate file which can be loaded on request on top of the
system.  Note that almost any piece of code can be
replaced in a lisp system merely by loading a file
that redefines functions and data.  So the main
point would be to keep two people from independently
implementing the same new feature.  Is there a "to-do"
list concept in sourceforge?

Yes, that would be very nice. And also give reference to actual
books that say something worthy about Maxima/Macsyma. I can give couple
of references, if you're interested.

Yes that's all you need.  But doing it is a lot of work because it's
all quite manual.  And you have to understand how the Lisp side wants
to work and how the C side wants to work.  Sometimes they don't want
to work together because the assumptions are different.

It can be done, but it's not easy.  I'd prefer a Lisp solution if
possible, especially because every one wins, not just the the lucky
ones which are using that particular system.

But, I don't normally use maxima for computation; I use it for
symbolic results.

Language: English.  Pub type: Practical

Abstract: The successes and failures of the Macsyma algebraic 
manipulation system are reviewed from the point of view of one of the 
original contributors. A retrospective examination is provided of some 
of the controversial ideas that worked, and some that did not. 
Input/output, language semantics, knowledge-adjunction, mathematical 
semantics, the model of the user, and other issues are considered. 
Possible future directions for algebraic manipulation system building 
are discussed.

Message-ID: <200110151559.f9FFx6J29315@convair.dt.navy.mil>



Hi all.

I need to do a Taylor expansion of a fn w/r/t a derivative, that is:

depends(x,t);
f: <some expression with diff(x,t)>  ;
taylor(f,diff(x,t),0,1);

I guess I could do something like

subst(foo,diff(x,t));
taylor(%,foo,0,1);
subst(diff(x,t),foo,%);

but is there perhaps a cleaner way to do this?

thanks!

I think that having different maintainers for different parts of
Maxima is a good idea, but having maintainance by any sort of
committee doesn't seem like a good idea, particularly a rather
unstructured committee.  There's also the problem of
who commits the changes to sourceforge, etc.

I (as well with most people, most likely) agree here, although I
understand why Richard might not want to take this on.  It's
worth noting, though, that particularly if there were several
submaintainers, the overall coordinator probably wouldn't be
integrating the code, etc.

Actually, revising this to make it more meaningful is entirely

Finally mystery is resolved. The point is that GCL by default
allocates very little free space and it is very "lazy" in
allocating extra free space. It makes hundreds of garbage
collection before requesting some more memory.
Pre allocating memory on startup improves situation dramatically.

It is turned out that GCL 2.4.0 compiled with gmp support is
especially susceptible to the problem since it actively uses
cfun space for computation (as far as I understand without mp
this space isn't needed for usual computation but for
storing compiled functions code only).
So, to make GCL 2.4.0 with gmp run really fast one need
to make init.lsp which looks something like this
(progn
  (si::allocate 'cons 20000 t)
  (si::allocate 'fixnum 4000 t)
  (si::allocate-relocatable-pages 10000 t)
  (si::allocate 'cfun 5000 t)
  (si::set-gmp-allocate-relocatable t)
)
The last two lines are essential for GCL compiled with gmp.

With pre allocated memory new results are as follows.

Maxima 5.6 + GCL 2.3.8beta3 (no gmp)
expand((x+y+z)^300)$                 44 sec
ratsimp((x+y+z)^300)$                2.8 sec

Maxima 5.6 + GCL 2.4.0 (gmp)
expand((x+y+z)^300)$                 33 sec
ratsimp((x+y+z)^300)$                1.6 sec

Thus gmp is really faster.

Can't blame you there :-)  For the first, I know a little about
Sourceforge and would be willing to learn whatever else about that I
need to to help with that aspect of things.

We obviously want to avoid that, but we also don't want to discourage
such energy.  That's why the idea of having an experienced leader is so
good - that person can direct the energies of interested people,
propose needed tasks, etc.  I know better than to try and code for
Maxima, so I'll be restricted to documentation and testing (hopefully
useful tasks) but there may be some people who can start out by
handling small jobs, which can be checked over by the experienced
coders, and then critiqued until everyone feels that the code is worth
including.  We could stress that while we appreciate all efforts to
improve maxima, certain standards must be met before it will be
included, and work with people as long as they are willing to work in
order to make their code usable in Maxima.

True.  However, if well defined minor tasks can be assigned, we still
might get some useful work done.  People must learn to walk before thay
can run.

Absolutely. But by the same token, we should be very willing to listen
to such proposals.  We need interest.  If we get a lot of proposals
that aren't so good we might start a document detailing them and why
they aren't good ideas.  That in itself might be very educational for a
lot of people.

Yes there is, although I don't have too much experience with using it. 
(Anyone?)  It is called the Task list.  I've set up a basic example
here: http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=22406

Suggestions:
  The manual might start with:

chapter N
           2. How do I get Maxima?  Go to "Installation Guide"
            3. What is Maxima anyway? Continue reading here..


Telling people (in the introduction) why free software is nice,

seems like an unnecessary digression to me, at least at this point.


I would also hope that most people would not have to install
Maxima very often, so those instructions don't go in the
  User Manual, but in the "Installation Guide".

Good start.

Good point, but I think normally those questions are posed in a README
file, not in the manual itself.  The Chapter headings in the table of
contents (if properly named) should pretty much handle that
automatically as far as the Manual is concerned.

Hmmm...  Well, I suppose, but I thought it would be good to enable
people to make an informed choice about whether or not to use Maxima -
the kind of information I was hoping to compile in the overview at the
beginning is stuff I've spent quite a while looking for all over the
place on the web. Maybe the thing to do is put those sections at the
back - that way we will start out with the basics, but still have that
information present.  Also, at least in my experience, people tend to
have the impression that anything free is something to avoid, because
it can't be any good, so I thought maybe we should address that point
up front.  

> I would also hope that most people would not have to install

How about this, as a compromise:  We could have various chapters
written in their own files, and then several master documents which
include selected chapters. 


Install.tex
    |
    |
     ----  installchapter.tex

AllDocumentation.tex
    |
    |
     ----  basicschapter.tex
    |
     ----  trigchapter.tex
    |
     ....
    |
     ----  installchapter.tex
    |
     ----  othersystems.tex
    |
     ----  history.tex
    |
     ----  etc.

UsingMaxima.tex
    |
    |
     ----  basicschapter.tex
    |
     ----  trigchapter.tex
    |
     ----  etc. 

Or something like that.  That way, if someone only wanted the Install
stuff, they could just say latex Install.tex and have what they want. 
If, they want everything, they could just say latex
Alldocumentation.tex, which I guess was what I started to write, and
have one book containing everything about Maxima (personally that's
what I would want.)  We could decide as a group what we think would be
the best information to have in the User Manual, and just include those
chapters in UserManual.tex.  The only requirement for this type of
setup, if I understand tex correctly, is that each chapter would have
to be in a different file, so we could use the \input command in the
master files.

Sorry, I wasn't clear enough. All this happened with my last example, that is 
with

(C3) Solve((a^2+1)*x^2+a^3*x+1=0,x);

If I run this line, maxima has no output, but uses up 98 %CPU, and this until 
I interrupt with a Ctrl-C (actually 2 Ctrl-C, because I'm using emacs). 

And if I wait for a while before using the Ctrl-C, chances are that maxima 
aborts. (More ^Cs only go deeper down in the lisp-level but won't abort.) 
Last time the message was

*******
(C2) Solve((a^2+1)*x^2+a^3*x+1=0,x);

>Here I waited for about 2 minutes
>Here I gave the Ctrl-C Ctrl-C

Correctable error: Console interrupt.
Signalled by MACSYMA-TOP-LEVEL.
If continued: Type :r to resume execution, or :q to quit to top level.

Process Maxima aborted

I don't know if it could be worth but as someone mentioned earlier in
the list a good starting point would be to copy some other documentation
efforts of open source programs

I use lyx and everyone agrees in the excellent documentation that
accompanies this nice piece of software. They have structured the help
documentation in several documents. A maxima replicant outline could be:

o Introduction. General recommendations on how to use the documentation
and what it is expected to find through the other documents:

o Tutorial. How to start with maxima, solving simple maths,
miscellaneous. This could be C.Y section 4, Basics, plus a more general
overview on other capabilities of maxima, a complete session with
graphics and text output, and the basic input using, etc, ...including
many of the examples that comes in maxima manual would be worth. This
document is the key to retain many users because it must provide a full
picture of what maxima can do by examples.

o User's guide. A fully comprehensive guide to maxima describing deeply:
maxima setup, supporting applications, i.e, graphics stuff, maxima
basics, maxima and lisp, 

o Extended Features: perhaps C.Y part II, sections 12 and 13 about
current external packages and modules, how to use them, description of
the main packages, ...,

o Customization: how to configure maxima, how to create new packages or
modules, 

o Reference Manual. The full reference to the maxima commands. 

o FAQ

o Known bugs

o Lisp Configuration or some aspects related to different lisps

The idea is to start from a very basic and quick guide to learn the
basics by examples, Tutorial, and to progress to a more deeply knowledge
by increasing 
the details and difficulty in a progressively way by using the suer's
guide and finally the extended, customization and reference manuals.

Anyway, this is a very nice start and most of the parts of the puzzle
are there, so keep on your good work !!

Oscar

Hi Everybody,

Probably I'm joining this discussion a bit late, and since I'm not
writing any documentation myself you can take my opinion for what
it's worth, but ...

Is LyX really a good platform for writing a large technical document?
The latex output which it produces is not of the best quality, and
might end up becoming difficult to maintain. Latex itself is not
very difficult to write by hand, and that would give you much
more control over the formatting, eg. making it easier to define
consistent macros for notation, cross-referencing, etc. 

It's possible that LyX has come a long way since I last looked at it
seriously, but I'm skeptical. In fact, just now I installed a new copy
and could not correctly re-import a tex file that I exported from LyX
itself ...

The document linked earlier in this thread looks fine, I'm just
concerned about what the underlying latex looks like.

I suspect taking the time to learn writing latex directly (again: it's
easy, I work in a building full of computer semi-literates and we all
use it to write scientific papers, books, and technical documentation)
would very quickly pay off over the first-glance benefit of a wysiwyg
editor.

In any case, it's good to see someone working on this so keep it up,
Denis.

In addition, is latex the right format?  I would like html pages so I
can look things up in a browser.  I'd also like the new reference
manual accessible from within maxima via describe.

I've not had very good luck with latex to html converters, and who
wants to rewrite maxima's describe that's tightly coupled to texinfo
to use something else?  (However, perhaps it would be easy for maxima
to start up a browser to read documentation, as some of the clhs
packages do for lisp.  This is fine for me.)

The manual itself looks fine.  I would have separate installation
manual and a user/reference guide.

Message-ID: <4nelo2ieb8.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

A couple of bugs in tex output:

(C99) gamma(1/4)^2;
					2 1
(D99) 				   GAMMA (-)
					  4
(C100) tex(%);
$$%GAMMA^{2}\left(\mathchoice {{1}\over{4}}{{1}\over{4}}{1//4}{1//4}
 \right)$$

That %GAMMA should, at least, be GAMMA.  The % comments out the rest
of the line.

I think the gamma function isn't usually written with the exponent
next to the gamma symbol; it usually follows the function:
$\Gamma(1/4)^2$.

P.S. Any one interested in a latex version?  Don't have one, but I
never use plain tex so when I dropped the above into latex, I get the
message

Package amsmath Warning: Foreign command \over;
(amsmath)                \frac or \genfrac should be used instead
(amsmath)                 on input line 94.

The output was ok. (Well, except I would have wanted \Gamma.  It's on
the todo list given in mactex.lisp)

I agree that LaTeX is the better way to go - I just used Lyx to to that
part so I'd have something to work with as I learn LaTeX.  I've already
begun the process of cleaning up the LaTeX code, and once I've got it
into a usable state, we can go to town.

Umm...  I think you're confusing the user manual and the reference
manual.  What we are doing here is the user manual.  Reference will
come later, after we have more people who have read the user manual
:-).  At that point, we'll think about working with describe.

Not sure, since I have no idea how difficult that would be.  As for
html, what we can do is once we have a full, complete manual we can run
the converter and then fix it up by hand where we need to.  That will
be a bit of a pain, and I'd only want to do that when we are at the
stage of releasing a full manual.

That's probably the preferable solution.

That's a popular opinion.  See my other replys for a possible way to
work that.  If I'm decisively overruled then we can do it using
multiple documents only, but at least two of us want to have the option
of everything in one big book.

Ok.  I hope the user and reference manual stay in sync then.
Hopefully the reference manual will be more up-to-date.

I did this for the CMUCL User's manual.  It was originally in
latexinfo.  Converted it to latex, which was easy.  Getting latex2html
to convert the latex into html was a giant pain.  Taking several hours
to do the conversion didn't help either.  In fact, since that initial
effort, I have been unable to get latex2html to convert it again
since.  I have heard there are some errors in the latex source, but I
don't know where they are.

However, there are other converters (hevea) that seem to work better.
That's how the current CMUCL manual is done.

If HTML is important, it is important that NO manual twiddling is
needed.

I agree, but since there seem to be differing opinions why not have our
cake and eat it too?  In my last response to Richard I outlined a way I
thought we might be able to work it - have each chapter unit contained
in a different file, and include different units in different
documents.  That way, Tuukka and I can get our huge all in one manual,
and other people could get just the basics.  That way, only one install
document has to be maintained, i.e. the installchapter.tex file, and it
can be used either in a stand-alone Install.tex or in BigManual.tex.

There will probably be some specific components which would only work
in one document - i.e., tutorial components might not work in a Manual
where the information is already covered in more depth, but I think
there would be enough overlap to make it worthwhile.

If this sounds OK to everyone, I can start adapting the current Lyx
file into LaTeX and breaking it up into multiple files, and maybe we
can make this the first upload into sourceforge CVS?  I know the main
Maxima effort is still wavering about where to host the project, but I
think the documentation team could benefit from the resources there.

hi Judah

my answer is that
diff(x,t) is an arbitrary function,so we cannot do taylor expansion
with this function.
It is almost meaningless for all computer algebra system.

So your problem shoud be understood a spectral problem.
dx/dt=sum(b[i]*t^i,i,0,n);
f(x)=sum(a[i]*x^i,i,0,m);
so,
 x=c+sum(b[j]/(j+1)*t^(j+1),j,0,n);
solve e[0],given a[i],b[i]
subst([x=...],f(x))=sum(e[i]*(dx/dt)^i,i,0,k);

after all with maxima

(C1) depends(x,t)$
(C2) gradef(x(t),sum(b[i]*t^i,i,0,3))$
(C3) f(x):=sum(a[i]*x^i,i,0,3)$
(C4) subst([x=c+sum(b[j]/(j+1)*t^(j+1),j,0,3)],f(x))$
(C5) sum(e[i]*sum(diff(x(t),t)^j,j,0,3),i,0,3)$
(C6) ppu:expand(D5-D4)$
(C7) eq1:coeff(ppu,t,0)$
(C8) eq2:coeff(ppu,t,1)$
(C9) eq3:coeff(ppu,t,2)$
(C10) solve([eq1,eq2,eq3],[e[0],e[1],e[2]]);

convergence is another problem,I think.

There is a nice book,we obtain pdf version from internet.
I recommend this book,he mainly use maple but we can use maxima.

That's kind of what I'm thinking - the reference manual will be updated
at the same time an update is loaded into CVS, while the User Manual
will be updated for a release.

While, I guess it will pay if we write clean LaTeX.  I just ran
latex2html on the current file, and it was fairly quick and did most of
the stuff right.  (Pictures came out bad, but I don't think that's
latex2html's fault.)  I need to clean up my code some, but initial
indications seem to be that it can be made to work, with the possible
exception of math equations.

Not sure how important it is - I don't use it too much, but I'm not
sure about everybody else.  OK, quick survey - what form of
documentation do you use ordinarily guys?  HTML, ps, pdf, printed, etc?
 (In any case, I'll see if HTML can be made to work.)

PDF.

There are couple of problems with HTML--first, no HTML viewer support
vector graphics (such as EPS) as far as I know, and generally bitmaps
are just awful. My eyes start to ache if I try to read some HTML
document where math is in ugly bitmaps (althought I think that
some versions of latex2html can generate antialiased bitmaps which
is much better but still awful). Secondly, HTML tends to be
(althought it isn't necessary) splitted in hundreds of small files,
from which some thing is extremely hard to find. Not to mention
the fact that very rare browsers support antialiased text while
almost all PDF readers do.

PS is almost as good as PDF, but it doesn't have hyperlinks
(at least not with gv) and you can't do a text search very easily.

IBM, I think, has/had a DVI viewer of some sort.  Others do to.  Don't
know how well they work and on what platforms.

And the HTML doesn't have to have graphics.  A maxima text version of the
equation is probably ok, since it's pretty obvious what the text
version does, even if you don't know maxima.  (But I like equations.
"integrate" isn't quite the same as the integral sign.)

This is another memory-related feature of GCL. Maximal number of
memory
pages which GCL can allocate is the compilation time parameter
and
as far as I understand it can't be changed later at run time.
By default the limit is 32*1024 pages which amounts to 128Mb of 
RAM
with 4Kb page. I decided that this limit is too restrictive and
recompiled
Maxima with 64*1024. But init.lsp I posted allocates ~140Mb
and I did not noticed that this is above usual RAM limit.
I'm sorry for deceiving audience by bad example but
you can decrease numbers in your init.lsp accordingly.
Do not consider amount of pages allocated in this sample init.lsp
as anything like "optimal choice". In particular, it seems that
with
gmp portion of RAM allocated to cfun may be increased.
If you place
  (setq  si::*notify-gbc*  t)
into init.lsp then GCL will print short message upon each garbage
collection.
An important piece of information here is - which particular
memory type
causes garbage collection. If say cfun causes GC too frequently
then increase
preallocated space for cfun etc...

Too bad latexinfo seems to have died.
However, hyperlatex seems to be working pretty well, and seems to
provide a way of "hand-fixing" any problems (that may be run into when
converting it to html) inside the tex document.

Still, I wouldn't mind seeing info output possible.  
Are there any html to info converters?

There is a Maxima project page at Sourceforge already
(http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/maxima) administered by Steve
Horne.  (I seem to recall he set it up to take advantage of the mail
list capabilities.)  Is he on this list?

It seems to me that, more important than any administrative details,
something needs to be set up quickly.  Anything.
(I've been in too many groups where people spent so much time talking
about how to do something that nobody ever got around to doing
anything...) 
I seem to recall someone writing that Texas would open the CVS access
to Maxima so the project could continue.  This seems like the quickest
way to start, it can always be moved later.  Can this be done?

OK, thanks Richard.  I'll take a look at it when I get a chance.

You have a few examples of math formulas in fifth to seventh figures at: 

http://www.univ-orleans.fr/EXT/ASTEX/astex/doc/fr/nouv30a/html/nouv30a.htm

which are quite readable I think ? In my implementation of TeX4ht ( software by 
E. Gurari to transform Plain TeX or LaTeX2.09/2e to html) I use dvidot (by E. 
Mattes) to generate automatically formulas as bitmaps, and it is even better 
(although I have not put any example on the web).

The criterion "beautiful / not awful" is maybe important for artwork, but for 
mathematics, in my opinion, the criterion for displaying math on the web ought to 
be "exact". Formulas available as bitmaps cannot be modified and will always be 
displayed correctly as created originally by the author by any browser, provided 
only it is able to display correctly bitmaps. 

Formulas available as parts of pdf files, with symbols taken from vector fonts 
are displayed certainly more beautifully, but they can be displayed incorrectly 
on the user's machine even if it has been displayed correctly on the machine of 
the author, for a multitude of reasons. With pdf for example, a paper of mine was 
printed correctly with Acrobat Reader 3, but with AR 4 some letters were not 
printed. Or a character can be substituted to another one, for example A can be 
displayed instead of  greek alpha, il the font used on the user's machine is 
bugged or ill-installed.

This might not be too dramatic for pure text, and for not too important text 
(say, personal letters, internal notes in a Univ dept etc.), as the mind can 
correct errors in general (as one can understand mistyped words from the 
context). But in maths, it would be catastrophic if a formula written (a+b)^2 by 
the author and displayed as such on his machine, is displayed (a+b) on the 
machine of user X, and (alpha+b)^2 on machine of user Y, because there is no way 
for the mind to correct a formula, except by refinding it, which may be very 
long.

In short : with pdf and vector fonts, there is no way to guarantee that a 
formula, displayed correctly for somebody, will be displayed correctly for 
somebody else at some other time. Especially for Acrobat Reader, it is not free 
software and there is no way for the scientific community to control its quality. 
The past experience seems to show that each version brings its own set of bugs, 
in an unpredicatble way and with no guarantee that they will be corrected.

If one wants to stick with pdf files, it seems to me that the only reasonable way 
to have mathematics articles that can be read safely in the long term (for 
articles posted in public archives such at arxiv.org), is using bitmap fonts, as 
generated by Dvips+Ghostscript. Acrobat Reader is very poor at displaying such 
fonts, display is ugly, and one has to use Ghoscript to display these pdf files 
in a readable way.

> Secondly, HTML tends to be

Well, html does not tend to anything, it is the authors that do tend to splitting 
documents in hundreds of small files, to allow fast loading and browsing. But as 
you say, there is no necessity : you can generate from a single LaTeX or texinfo 
file both types: large number of small files, adapted to fast load and browsing, 
and one unique huge file adapted to text search. In the GNU project, both types 
are available, for (almost?) all docs, so you have the choice. With PDF, usually 
you have only the opportunity to load a big file. So I would say html is more 
versatile.

> Not to mention
> the fact that very rare browsers support antialiased text while
> almost all PDF readers do.

The necessity for antialiasing with pdf files comes from its limitation:  you 
cannot increase the size of characters displayed, because the width of text is 
fixed, and to read a line with big characters, you have to zoom and then use 
scrollbar to read each line, if the line is not entirely displayed on your screen 
- whic is very uncomfortable.

There is no necessity with html, as lines are wrapped automatically in the 
window. html is issued from sgml, so you ought not to have the size of a font 
embedded in a html file : if some text is displayed in an illegible manner on 
your machine, the html solution is to display it with a larger font, adapted to 
the size of your screen and the state of your eyes. There is no need of 
antialiasing, whose aim is to improve display of text at a given size.

I believe this is getting a bit offtopic. If people request, I'll turn
this thread into private email. I also try to answer shortly, also because
many things are subjective and everyone has one's own opinion about the
matter.

I don't actually think so, I can actually see the jagged edges. And if I
would print it, it would be much worse. For printing, antialiased graphics
makes the result *worse*. This is because printers can't do true grayscales
but have to dither it.

Sure, but in my opinion it should be *readable*. Why many people prefer
reading from paper instead of screen? Because the text on paper just looks
so much better. Even if it is equally well understandable on the screen,
the quality nevertheless matters.

>Formulas available as parts of pdf files, with symbols taken from vector fonts

I believe this would be a bug either in the PDF file or in the PDF reader
software. Most probably a missing or bad font in the reader, or possibly a
broken font in the PDF creator.

It is fixed by fixing the PDF creator software or the reader.

>In short : with pdf and vector fonts, there is no way to guarantee that a

I think it can be quaranteed by embedding the math font into the PDF file.
For example pdflatex does this for certain fonts.

>somebody else at some other time. Especially for Acrobat Reader, it is not free
>software and there is no way for the scientific community to control its quality.

Of course not. But xpdf and ghostscript can both read PDF files well.

>The necessity for antialiasing with pdf files comes from its limitation:  you

You are right in a way. Both HTML and PDF try to be device independent, but
in a very different way. HTML is independent of the screen (or printer)
font, width and resolution for text, but bitmap pictures are very device
resolution dependent.
PDF is independent of display resolution, including images, but
unfortunately not screen/printer width or even height.

Given a good HTML viewer (haven't found one yet) I'd prefer more HTML than
PDF. This good HTML viewer would be fast, take little memory, support
antialiased fonts, support antialiased vector graphics (possibly as PDF or
PS) and be free.

Needless to say :-)  Do you mean you couldn't read the formulas?

We were speaking about reading on screen, and finding text in pdf vs html files, 
etc. I didn't suggest to print from html versions, for printing, it is better to 
use dvi or ps version of course, formatting can be better anyway.

Yes, but by whom and when? If I need a formula right now and the reader is broken 
or some font is incorrect and I am not aware of it, I read an incorrect result. 
With bitmap equations, with the sole condition that the reader displays correctly 
a bitmap, I can be sure all equations will be displayed correctly. If an html 
browser would display incorrectly bitmaps, it can be seen immediately. In a 
bitmap, the formula is embedded for ever in its exact form, as it is on paper. In 
a pdf file with vector fonts, the image of the equation is recreated each time 
the equation is displayed or printed, and each time it can be recreated 
incorrectly.

Yes, it is certainly necessary, but not sufficient in my opinion, as new bugs can 
be introduced anytime in a new version of the reader.

I think that appearance is important.  The
mathematica books and on-line material look
good to me.  I suspect TeX / PDF /Display
PostScript is what was used.

TeXmacs or LyX
or even emacs --- any program not commercially supported
which requires SEPARATE installation from
Maxima to be used -- should be used with
great caution.  Anything that does not
run well on Windows -- like it or not, the most
common operating system --  can't be considered
seriously.

I'm OK with Acrobat Reader, though I agree
it is possible to get into trouble if you
  do not play the right games with fonts.


The appearance of html is often unpredictable
and often poor unless you make bitmaps. It is
also very bulky for what you actually encode.


There are some fancy display programs like Livemath
and tech explorer (a plug-in from IBM), but they

require separate downloads.

I'm not sure what we are arguing about here - are we talking about what
format to write the documentation in, or what forms we should be able
to generate it in, or what form we want to use as the in-program viewer
for documentation?  

If we are talking about what the original documents are written in, you
can do LaTeX anywhere.  LyX actually will run on Windows, if you have
an X server, but I think for a number of reasons it will be better to
move to LaTeX in any case.  That's about as universal as you can get.

As for what types of documentation we can generate, I think we are
going to do as well with LaTeX as with any other option.  We get ps,
dvi and pdf, and I think we can also get html and txt.  

As far as inline viewing, that's probably something to save for when we
get to the reference manual, which will be the manual we want to access
directly from Maxima.  We will need txt display for the terminal
displays, and probably html and pdf as well for other applications.

In any case, I'd be even MORE wary of commerical programs than I would
of free ones.  Macsyma Inc. is an excellent case in point.  If the
commerical company dies, it takes it's product with it.  emacs,
TeXmacs, and Lyx will survive, even if they aren't popular - it will
always be possible to read their stuff one way or another.

We can run trial viewings in a variety of platforms before we release
it.  Actually, now that you mention it, did anyone have trouble with
the pdf document I put up earlier?

It has the advantage of being truly universal, though, or at least as
much so as any of the browser formats.  The only hope currently for a
truly standard web math is mathml, which isn't even close to being
properly implimented except maybe in mozilla.  It's also bulky, so
right now at least we are stuck with html.

If we are worrying about display programs vanishing with time, I
definitely wouldn't use anything like that.

As there seems to be a discussion of formats ... I would recommend
Texinfo, the standard GNU format.  

I have used this for a 500+ page manual involving a lot of
mathematics, and it works fine in my opinion (see the documentation
links at http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/ for example).  It was also
used for the 'GNU Emacs Calc' and 'GNU R' manuals, which are
mathematical too.

I have successfully converted the file from Texinfo into the following
formats:

   HTML (with and without equation images -- I prefer without), 
   PDF (with scalable fonts), 
   Windows WinHelp (& HTMLHelp)

as well as Postscript (US Letter, A4, and 6"x9" trade paperback) and
Info of course.

I have tried some of the other solutions out there at various times
and they did not match up to Texinfo under heavy usage in my opinion.

regards
Brian Gough

Ok, so then the user would need to print another version of the document
than what he's reading on the screen.

Bugs could be in HTML reader too. But since PDF reader is more complex,
I believe, it may easier have bugs.

The following trick works (delayed evaluation):

(C1) f(x):=if (x>0) then 1.0 else 0.0;

(D1)                  f(x) := IF x > 0 THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0
(C2) plot2d('(f(x)),[x,-2,2]);

However, I have another question: there are
many interesting plotting functions descrobed in the file
share/plot2.usg

But there is no plot2.lisp or plot2.lsp or plot2.mc...
For instance paramplot2 would have be another 
way to plot the Heaviside function.
Are these functions dead or alive?

Best regards. 

P. S. Note about the _very_ small French team
working on maxima : No, folks, you are not alone ;o)
We are with you. But we have a big task to achieve
(the translation) and we are just beginners in
most of maxima and lisp.

I've contacted him, and he seems willing to let us use the site.  I
just used the above address because I am admin there and could set it

Presumably, but we need to know who commits stuff, who verifies it,
etc.  I've been trying to get some kind of structure togeather, but
Richard is understandably reluctant to lead and no one has volunteered.
 I am unqualified to lead, and if I were to try the result would be a
disaster.  We need someone who has the knowledge and will to step up
and do this.  Until we have that I'm not sure where we can go.  If
nothing else we'll just have to do our best as a group - that's one of
the reasons I think it's important to document what we have.  That way,
when we do get ahold of someone with leadership will and technical
skill, they won't have to navigate a wilderness blind.  That part, at
least, we can try to do.  I'm planning to move the documentation effort
to sourceforge once I clean up the code from my first attempt, and that
can at least get underway.  Currently I'll be working on a user manual,
install docs, and other general interest stuff.  This won't directly
help maxima, but if we can make the road to usage easier for people we
might convince someone it's worth the effort to forge the threads into
a structured development effort.  And in the meantime, those we do have
will be learning the system, and gaining skill (right guys? ;) with
maxima and lisp.

1) I've been wondering about this for a while now - does anyone here
know how the heck the Windows binary was made?  The readme file with it
says a little about what tools were used, but no details.  If we are
going to release for Windows at some point, it would be good to know
how to make a binary for Windows.  Does anyone know what the procedure
is?
If they do, would you be willing to write it up and submit it to the
list?  Then I could give it a try on a Windows machine we have here and
write it up in gory detail for the manual.  If need be I'll try to
figure it out myself at some point but that would most likely be less
than optimal.


2) Does anyone know what the best cross platform toolkit out there is? 
I'm wondering because my searching hasn't turned up any major graphical
interface library efforts for lisp since garnet, and I'm not really
sure how suitable or portable that is.  (It was written before Windows,
so I'm betting that would be a problem.)  If at some point in the
future we decide to jazz up the interface we would need to write an
interface to some toolkit, and I was curious if anyone had experience
here.  Currently xmaxima uses TCL/Tk, and I personally know about
wxWindows and FOX - are there any other good ones?

I have other things on my plate at the moment, but there is
a possibility that next semester  (jan 2002 ) will be
less busy; I will
be teaching a graduate seminar and it might even be possible
that some students there could help.  Though making a windows
installation script is not something I know anything about,
and could not expect a student to know.  These are graduate
students mostly...

There is a possibility of some help from people who know
very well how to do such things at Franz Inc; I have not
found anyone with "spare time"  but the idea of having an
allegro common lisp  (which has an interactive development
environment etc etc)  and a macsyma "dll" seems quite
feasible.
   The tricky part though is that not everyone wants
to use a commercial lisp, even if it is sort of free
(student/ demo  "tryout").  Also the student versions
may not have the amount of free storage we might want.
(Asking Franz Inc to make a "free Maxima"  when it
is tantamount to asking them to give away the program
that they sell, does not work.  ... in case you
haven't noticed, you can take any version of maxima
and with a bit of typing change it into the underlying
lisp..)


Outside of the Maxima issue, is there a GCL group, or
leader?

There's a native Aqua port of Tcl/Tk for Mac OS X, if I recall xmaxima

I want to know more about that, specifically how Tcl/Tk merges with xmaxima.
So far, xmaxima is a command-line tool for me.

Thanks a lot,

I second stongly the texinfo format. It was precisely designed to
facilitate converting into other common document formats.
Using texinfo one can easily get
.info - good for online browsing on text console
.html - good for online browsing under any GUI
.tex - for high quality printed documents
.tex can be easily converted into .pdf or .ps.

I compiled maxima-gcl with a higher MAXPAGE and used Vadims init.lsp, i.e. 

(progn
(si::allocate 'cons 20000 t)
(si::allocate 'fixnum 4000 t)
(si::allocate-relocatable-pages 10000 t)
(si::allocate 'cfun 5000 t)
(si::set-gmp-allocate-relocatable t)
(setq  si::*notify-gbc*  t))

Then I tried to find out how fast this new version would be. I used 

factor(expand((x+y)^n)+1)$

for n=30, 60, 100, and 105. With 100 maxima (gcl) run into serious problems:

(C7) factor(expand((x+y)^100)+1)$

[GC for 7500 RELOCATABLE-BLOCKS pages..(T=12).GC finished]
[GC for 5000 CFUN pages..(T=15).GC finished]
[GC for 7500 RELOCATABLE-BLOCKS pages..(T=15).GC finished]
[GC for 5000 CFUN pages..(T=15).GC finished]
[GC for 5000 CFUN pages..(T=15).GC finished]
[GC for 7500 RELOCATABLE-BLOCKS pages..(T=13).GC finished]

[GC for 5000 CFUN pages..(T=15).GC finished]
[GC for 7500 RELOCATABLE-BLOCKS pages..(T=12).GC finished]
etc

I had to interrupt it. The reason was 
(si::set-gmp-allocate-relocatable t)

without this line, the times were:
n=30: 0.7 sec; n=60: 4.04 sec; n=100: 4.07 sec; n=105: 317.27 sec
That was with 121 M Ram in use.

Now the numbers for clisp:
n=30: 0.58 sec (4.5 M RAM); n=60:  5.45 sec (4.8 M); n=100: 11.79 sec (4.6 
M); n=105: 60.89 sec (5.2 M);

And cmucl:
n=30: 0.15 sec (11 M RAM); n=60:  2.19 sec (12 M); n=100: 5.05 sec (15 M); 
n=105: 28.51 sec (17 M);

The numbers for RAM were what I could observe in top as RSS, of course that's 
not very precise. There's one point I don't understand: cmucl loads a 
"maxima.core" with

I decided to repeat your test and I've got similar results.

Maxima 5.6 (latest CVS)+GCL 2.4.0 with (si::set-gmp-allocate-relocatable t)
n=30:    0.1
n=60:    1.69
n=100:  killed after very long time

The same ;;(si::set-gmp-allocate-relocatable t) commented out
n=30:    1.39
n=60:    40.18 (lots of CONTIGUOUS-BLOCKS garbage collections)

I also noticed other very strange errors with combination Maxima 5.6 (latest
CVS)+GCL 2.4.0.
By default (no any init.lsp) it fails on standard maxima tests. It either goes
into infinite (or very
long loop) on some TRIGSIMP test or stops with with "Quotient by zero" message
on other PARTFRAC test. But is use init.lsp as above then all tests are OK!
It seems that anyway something is seriously wrong GCL 2.4.0 and I suspect that
gmp is the troublemaker. So I switched back to GCL 2.3.8-beta3.
And repeated tests once again. First of all now I do not have any problems
with standard maxima tests. They all pass whether with init.lsp or not.
And now results of factor(expand((x+y)^n+1)$ tests.

Maxima 5.6 (latest CVS)+GCL 2.3.8-beta8 with init.lsp
as above but without (si::set-gmp-allocate-relocatable t)
and with cfun reduced to 200 instead of 5000
n=30:    0.15
n=60:    4.84
n=100:  7.03
n=105:  36.10
RAM initially was 140Mb but finally it increased to 188Mb.

Much better. The behavior is at least predictable.
I'd not recommend to use GCL 2.4.0 with Maxima.

There is also another method to improve GCL memory allocation.
Function allocate-growth tells GCL how to allocate
new chunks of RAM if memory of some type is exhausted.
The size of the chink can be tuned as well.
But frankly I'd better move Maxima to other lisp.
My experience with GCL is not so promising so far.
I think this is important with respect to Maxima future.
Many times I've heard that Maxima suffers from bad performance
and now I see that significant part of the problem is not in
the Maxima itself but rather in the background lisp system.
Quite sad :-(

Best wishes,

Vadim

FWIW, garnet *is* portable between X11 and Mac...

"CLIM" is the ultimate lisp GUI. There is an ongoing effort of getting
together a free implementation - but nobody should be holding their
breath. It run on top of CLX.

I believe commercial lisp vendors support CLIM under Windows.

Dear Maxima users,

I have just attemped to go through examples given in the manual about
using itensor package. I found that  practically  all examples don't work
for me.
For instanse:
after sending to maxima the following:load(itensor,fasl,tensr);
dim:3;
declare(e,constant);
metric:g;
components(g([p,q],[]),e([p,q],[])*P([],[]));
components(g([],[p,q]),e([],[p,q])/P([],[]));

show(g([i,j],[]))$

I have:(C1)
Loading ./itensor.lisp
Finished loading ./itensor.lisp
(D1) 			        ./itensor.lisp
(C2)
(D2) 				       3
(C3)
(D3) 				     DONE
(C4)
(D4) 				       g
(C5)
(D5) 				     DONE
(C6)
(D6) 				     DONE
(C7)
(D7) 				   g
				    $i|/$j|
(C8)
So the definitions for the metric componets does not work here. Meanwhile
the manual said that we could get here the expression for g([i,j],[])
through tensor e. The indice's representation is not the same as written
in manual. For instance if I repeat (C7) I have nothing. I found no
problem with package "ctensr". Everything was ok there and in
 correspondence with manual.
Is it possible to use "itensor" in correct way or it is broken?
I'm asking it because itensor.lisp remains in the source directory after
"make install".

Is it possible to find an information about using maxima in tensorial
calculus anywhere in the web. In the maxima help there is reference to
publications on MIT/LCS/TM-167. What is it?

Thank you everybody in advance.

He seems to be relenting a little bit.
I think that Richard is the best person for the job, and sincerely
hopes he takes it on.  As leader, of course, he could delegate
the bulk of the work.

We can get underway once we have CVS access.  There have already been
some bug fixes (the `apropos' bug, any others?) which could be
committed. But we need a place to commit them.
Do you have CVS access to the sourceforge site?  I asked Steve Horne
about it, but haven't heard back yet.

On the contrary, I think it absolutely will help maxima.
Documentation is an important part of a program.

I'm Steve Horne of the sourceforge site.
  Apparently "reply" to these messages isn't going
to the list -- sorry.

I set up the sourceforge site way back when and haven't been able to
support it appropriately due to time pressures. I'll be very glad -- 
estatic -- to see it used.  I'll happily turn it over to whoever wants
to maintain it.  Please feel free to contact me at

(D2)
(C3)sum(x^n,n,0,inf);

Is ABS(x) -1 positive,negative,or zero ?

negative;

Hi everybody,

I posted the message yesterday about subj but have no replay probably due
to the wrong topic there.

If anybody uses itensor.lisp in maxima,
Could you please tell me what is a result applying
this
load(itensor,fasl,tensr);
dim:3;
declare(e,constant);
metric:g;
components(g([p,q],[]),e([p,q],[])*P([],[]));
components(g([],[p,q]),e([],[p,q])/P([],[]));

show(g([i,j],[]))$

On my maxima this gives  g
		          $i|/$j|
 instead of
P e
   i j

as explained in manual. Well, the manual itself is written for MACSYMA. So
the result can be different of that  maxima gives.

Thanks in advance,
Valerij

Hi ,
could  you please look at my message more  carefully. With my maxima I
obtained just the same as you got. But  this mean that "itensor" does not
work in correct way.
What I said in previous message is that the result  of
final command
show(g([i,j],[])$
should be

P*e
   i j

as written in the manual(note the index representaion here also).
Acctually this test show that function - componets() does not work .
Otherwise the components of metric were be substituted in accordance with
definition by tensor e.

Thanks, but I was actually complaining that the display was not
properly formatted.  However, I've been informed that this bug was
fixed in the CVS sources a few months ago.

I am beginning to agree with you there.  There does not seem to be
any dedicated group working on GCL, and most of us here are (I think) 
only interested in GCL as a means to run Maxima.  Clisp seems to be
the most user friendly Lisp (yay readline) with a good build process
but if I recall correctly was the worst performer on the benchmark 
tests?  CMUCL looked like a real pain to compile when I downloaded 
the source. Which one do you think is best? Would it be possible to
select what you think is the best overall Lisp, and then start 
talking to the group that maintains it to add fixes for the 
limitations you run into?

There was a whole discussion on that some time back on the list - 
it's in the archive somewhere.  Regardless, I think having someone 
else maintain the Lisp end of things, with you to help them with
maxima issues, would be a Good Thing.

I've hacked on cl-info.lisp so that it can be used by Clisp.  Thus,
describe works on Clisp now.

You need a version of Clisp that has the regexp module.

I've also changed cmulisp-regex so that it can use the same
cl-info.lisp file.

I'm not sending it here since it's rather large, but if you want a
copy let me know.  It's still in an experimental stage, but it works
for me.  It's also much, much slower than GCL and maxima in looking up
items.  But it's better than nothing.

however, so I am continuing it here. Please redirect the conversation as
you see fit. I'm cc'ing the Maxima list for obvious reasons.) 

As I said before on the Maxima mailing list, I think that the future
direction for Maxima should be toward ANSI-CL and away from GCL
idiosyncrasies. To that end, I have a version of Maxima that builds
consistently with CLISP, CMUCL and GCL using mk:defsystem from CLOCC.
Much of what I have is derived from work done by Liam Healy, who
deserves most of the credit and none of the blame.

Building requires defsystem.lisp from CLOCC and (for the time being) my
patched version of CLOCC's run-lisp, which I have included.
To build with clisp:
	make
To build with CMUCL:
	make L=cmucl
To build with gcl
	make L=gcl

The Makefile is a temporary hack; I plan to setup an autoconf/automake
system for maxima so that it can be configured, built and installed in a
way familiar to users of other autoconf'ed projects. The lisp part will
continue to actually be built by mk:defsystem.

I also plan to write a wrapper script so that maxima can be invoked from
the command line in a manner independent of lisp implementation.

I'm sending this message now not because I have a polished final product
ready, but because I hope others will be interested in discussing and
working on it.

The differences between what I have and the current head of the maxima
cvs repository are quite small. I've appended the diff. Please let me
know if you would like a copy of the modified files.

You cannot build CMUCL from sources without a working CMUCL on either
the same or different platform.  This is also true for SBCL, a CMUCL
derivative.

Now that the info reader works for Clisp, I have no need to build and
run GCL anymore.  CMUCL probably runs as fast as GCL, but its bignum
performance is probably worse than GCL/GMP.  Clisp is very good there.
For numerical work, CMUCL is the probably the best of the three.

I *just* sent a message regarding getting Maxima on better footing with

Message-ID: <8D00C32549556B4E977F81DBC24E985D410019@crtsmail1.technol_exch.corp.riotinto.org>

I have spent the last couple of evenings trying to build maxima under
windows.  I don't know much about lisp, but I have built a lot of unix based
packages on a PC using gcc.  Unfortunately I left a couple of pages of notes
at home, so this is incomplete.  Hopefully something is better than nothing.

The windows binary on http://www.ma.utexas.edu/ is maxima-5.5, and is
missing a number of lisp files.  It was built in early December 2000. 

The tarball also contains a mingw binary of gcc-2.95.2, which is missing a
number of startup files.  There is enough gcc to compile an object file, but
not enough to link an executable.

I started by trying to build gcl-2.4.0.  There are some notes in
readme.mingw.  I already have the current cygwin (http://cygwin.com) and
mingw (http:/www.mingw.org) installed.  My first attempt, using mingw gcc
under bash, failed as the configure process set up a number of cygwin
symbolic links that the mingw gcc couldn't understand.  I made much more
progress using the cygwin gcc as a cross compiler to generate a mingw binary
using the -mno-cygwin option.  This required some hacking of the makefiles
and configuration files.  The end result is a raw_gsl.exe binary that fails
on startup with

GCL (GNU Common Lisp)  April 1994  32768 pages

Unrecoverable error: NULL_OR_ON_C_STACK macro invalid.


The same problems occur with my build of gcl-2.3.8-beta3. I started to debug
this, but then put it aside. 



On a different track, I tried compiling with clisp-2.27, using the method
given in http://mathshield.sourceforge.net/maximadoc.pdf.  This fails with

Compilation of file C:\junk\maxima-cvs\src\numerm.lisp is finished.
0 errors, 0 warnings
End compile NUMERM at Wed Oct 24 11:27:06 2001
;; Loading file numerm.fas ...
;; Loading of file numerm.fas is finished.
;; Loading file SYS-PROCLAIM.lisp ...
*** - There is no package with name "SERROR"
Bye.


I'd welcome any comments.  I guess I would prefer to get things working with
clisp, rather than try and support gcl.

It seems to me that the best strategy is to maintain Maxima compatible
with as many background lisps as possible both free and commercial
(if someone cares to do this). Tighting Maxima to any particular Lisp
incarnation which would be a terrible mistake. Whenever possible
any piece of  Maxima code  which  is particular Lisp dependent
must be replaced by standard compliant code. This is not easy way but
it seems that this is the only way to make Maxima future safe.
Lisps come and go...

This is theory. But what do we have in practice right now?
We have three Common Lisp implementations -
GCL, clisp and cmucl. Naturally GCL is good with Maxima
(btw I compiled GCL with the readline patch and it works
to me fine both in GCL and in Maxima). And I think the
immediate task is to make Maxima completely compatible
with clisp and cmucl as well. And as far as I know this
goal is almost achieved especially with clisp. At present
clisp seems to be the most reliable and stable but indeed
clisp is slowest of the three. Cmucl is the fastest option
and porting Maxima to it is not insurmountable as well.
As for GCL I expect more troubles with it in near future.
It has problems with gcc 2.96 and I guess it will have
troubles with gcc 3.0 as well (not tried yet).
But even with gcc 2.95.3 it suddenly stop to build
for me after recent glibc upgrade. I wish I'm
wrong  about GCL and It would be excellent if
someone take care of  it.

Best wishes,

Vadim

Does anyone know how to compile it? I guess it can be simple, but

Pedro,

 The new maxima users' manual has the procedure to build clisp maxima.
....
Change into the directory
$HOME/maxima/src (or $HOME/maxima-5.6/src - whatever your setup
dictates.) For newer versions of clisp, you need to change
a couple lines in the
 compile-clisp.lisp:
< (lisp:gc) ---> (ext:gc)
< lisp:saveinitmem "maxima-clisp.mem" ---> ext:saveinitmem "maxima-clisp.mem"
Then run the following commands:
make clisp-compile CLISP=clisp
make maxima-clisp.mem CLISP=clisp
make test-clisp CLISP=clisp
Once that is complete, you can either leave maxima where you built it,
or move the directory to a more suitable place.
....

OK, but is there someone who knows maxima well enough to decide what code 
could stay and what has to be changed? My feeling is that there isn't even a 
list of the maxima commands which are working. 
And if we had a maxima tied to a standard (is that common lisp), how about 
letting maxima use all the goodies cl comes with? I read (as good as I can) 
Common Lisp the Language and it was like reading a recipe of Mathematica 
commands for manipulating lists and all that (which I'm badly missing). If 
I'm right, couldn't one have all that stuff in maxima too?

In case it works fine with 128 M for me that means it does not work fine.

To me it looks as if maxima were no less compatible with clisp and/or cmucl 
as it is with gcl. Or should I say it the other way around, maxima isn't more 
compatible with gcl...?

I have it running on cmucl, of course without any idea of how good. And I 
haven't any idea about how it is done, I just followed instructions: If you 
have a look at the makefile in .../maxima/src (my version is the one debian 
distributes, with the diff also of debian, maxima_5.6-12.diff, applied) you 
will find (lines 279-285) what you have to tell make to have a cmucl maxima 
and how to call it afterwards. To me it works. (Sorry for the mess, but 
that's the way I do it.) And if you have a look at ChangeLog in the same 
directory you will find:
  
(2001-04-20  Bill Schelter  <wfs at sonia.ma.utexas.edu>

        * Now clisp and gcl work ok on all tests No errors found,
        and apparently cmulisp does too.

You state that clisp is the slowest of all three, to me this is not clear at 
all. First of all, to me gcl was the slowest, but of course it could be 
possible you know how to fix it. Second, gcl eats up memory that is not 
acceptable (I have 512 M RAM, but I'm very happy with that and I think I 
would better waste my memory in other things, say using pari for lots of 
calculations.

Almost, but not quite.  Maxima's debugger only works with GCL, I
think.  Definitely does not work with cmucl because cmucl does not
have evalhook.

That would be really, really, really cool.  That was one of the big
barriors for me when I first tried maxima - the nonstandard build
process.

I doubt that'll be a problem - in fact, that would probably be the best
thing.  One thing, though - can autoconf check for the presence of
mk:defsystem as part of its initial stuff, and give an informative
message about installing it if it isn't already present?  I am not sure
how to install mk:defsystem, which just shows how clueless I really am
with lisp - would it be possible for you to document how you set up
your lisp system to handle this setup?  Something like:

ERROR: mk:defsystem is not present in your lisp system
see INSTALL.mkdef for details on how to install it.

and then in INSTALL.mkdef have a step by step process for the lisps? 
(I'll be glad to handle writing it up if you can give me the steps and
put up with a few dumb questions.)
 
> I also plan to write a wrapper script so that maxima can be invoked

Also very cool.  Do you think maybe you could add an option (this may
be a bad idea, but it kind of strikes me as cool so I'll throw it out)
to tell the compile system to make binarys from different lisps, and
then have the script accept an option as to which lisp to run it in?

Say, for example, I wanted to compile maxima against GCL, CMUCL, and
Clisp, 'cause I'm a geek and want to use different lisps for different
types of jobs:

./configure --use-gcl --use-cmucl --use-clisp --default clisp

and that would have the make system build three binaries automatically.
 Then, once installed, the script could be used to select which lisp
you wanted to run with.  Say I wanted to do some fast calculations, I
could launch maxima with

maxima --cmucl

and when the students want to start it

maxima

will just give the default build with the more friendly Clisp.

Sorry if I'm off base again, but it sort of seemed like a cool idea.

Unfortunately I personally don't have the expertise to help you put it
togeather, but I'll volunteer to be an early and frequent tester.  Do
we have any autoconf gurus out there?

Definitely.  I think this is significant to the future of maxima, and
it should definitely be worked on.  Thanks for being willing to do
this.

Good. I'm glad to hear that someone else feels the same way. My goal is
that users unfamiliar with lisp will still be familiar with the
interface to the build system (i.e., ./configure ; make ; make install)
while allowing real lisp hackers to feel comfortable with what's under
the hood (mk:defsystem).

Yes. I'll check for mk:defsystem, etc. I'm only using two files from
CLOCC, defsystem.lisp and run-lisp, so it might be a good idea to bundle
a default version with the maxima distribution. Then again, it might
not. I haven't decided. At the very least, I would seek the blessing of
the CLOCC maintainers before doing so. I would also provide the option
to use an external version of those files.

Yes, that's what I plan to do. In fact, such a script already exists on

I'm happy to do the auto(conf,make) work. It's well within my expertise.
I can't promise to finish it for at least a month, however. (In Real
Life I'm in the process of preparing for SuperComputing 2001, which
happens early in November.)

I'm not proposing to revise whole Maxima code. As far as I understand Maxima
is mostly CL compliant. This is question of testing and fixing pieces of code
which give incorrect result on some Lisp. For example right now Maxima
works almost fine with clisp. It passes all tests. This is already very nice
but plot3d doesn't work and some other problems still can be discovered.
It is good idea to check all demo included in Maxima distributive.

Actually 128Mb is too much and preallocating just 20Mb

As I tried to say earlier Maxima was never extensively tested

The week point of GCL is memory allocation but if this issue is resolved
somehow then it is 2-5 times faster than clisp. Once again I repeat that
preallocating 128MB is too much for common needs.
The init.lsp I posted a few days ago allocates such huge amount of RAM
with the purpose to eliminate garbage collections completely even for such
large expression like (x+y+z)^300.

I wonder why standard Maxima installation procedure

install then as .mac or .mc files instead of .o.
Is there any rationale behind this?

Most of the machine/implementation code in Maxima is, I think,
in a very few files that define, depending upon the target
machine, different macro expansions.

My impression is that cmucl has an elaborate compiler that
takes a great deal of time but sometimes produces better code.
The allegro CL (commercial) that I use seems to be very
clever about garbage collection, and has various other
positive attributes, but has the negative aspect that
it is not free.
There are other lisps too; there is a site for the
association of lisp users.  There are free schemes,
and one computer algebra system (Jacal) written in
scheme.

matlisp bundles a copy of CLOCC defsystem.  Since mk:defsystem and
maxima are "free", it shouldn't be a problem.  You just have to
remember to keep it up-to-date.

Isn't this normally done as follows:

        mkdir maxima-on-gcl
        cd maxima-on-gcl
        ../configure --use-gcl
        ...
        cd ..

You could start with the autoconf file from matlisp as a start.  It
only supports ACL and CMUCL, but it works.  It also uses logical
pathnames to name everything and automatically figures out how to set
up the translations.

Right.

Yeah, that's the rub, or at least one of the rubs. I'm still not sure
keeping a private copy the right thing to do.

That's a good point. I wasn't thinking about that method. It is the
"normal" way. I think the situation here is a little abnormal, however.
I want to make it easy to keep versions for different lisps installed
simultaneously. In the "normal" method, what happens when you type "make
install" in both directories?

I have not looked at the matlisp packaging, but I will before I go any

No reason to make the user do all the mkdir stuff and whatnot by hand 
- that's what configure is all about.  The compile for each may proceed

in it's own directory, but unless he/she wishes to there should be no 
reason to know those details of the process.  Usually what happens 
when I compile stuff on Linux is that different parts get built in
different
directories, so what you are suggesting above is what configure does, 
but the user only ever supplies three commands - configure with
options, 
make, and make install.  (OK, occasionally make test too.) Configure is
typically very smart (or rather the person who has set it up is) so it 
handles all that automatically.

I haven't tried this, but presumably, configure will make the
appropriate changes so that the installation goes into specific
directories as needed.

I think XEmacs allows you to build this way and puts the binary,
platform specific stuff in known places via some configure switch
(--bindir?).  Haven't done this in a long time though.

    James> I have not looked at the matlisp packaging, but I will

May not be appropriate for what you want, but it's a start.  However,
it doesn't support "make install", and it assumes you only build and
use one system at a time.  Although, I think you could build and run
both because the lisp programs, libraries, and fasl files have
different names and/or extensions.  I don't have ACL, so I can't tell.

Your example is a bit different because you don't normally build some
package "foo" so that it can use some other package "bar" and "baz"
and "quux" all at the same time.

Having said that, yes, you can probably make configure do this.

I think he wants to add in Lisp's native ability to handle lists into 
Maxima.  Maybe J?rgen you could provide some specific examples of
what you'd like to be able to do?  I suppose set operations and the

Message-ID: <8D00C32549556B4E977F81DBC24E985D41001F@crtsmail1.technol_exch.corp.riotinto.org>

Following up on yesterday's post, I can report limited success with maxima
under windows.

Last night I:
 * built clisp-2.27 under using cygwin
 * built console version of CVS maxima using clisp
 * ran maxima testsuite with perfect results

Prior to this, I tried to build maxima using the win32 binary of clisp-2.27
from  http://clisp.cons.org/.  This failed when clisp went into an infinite
loop compiling one of the maxima files.

I will rebuild everything from scratch to work out the minimal set of
changes, and report back.

I can build maxima with clisp, but:

bash-2.05$ clisp -M maxima-clisp.mem 

(...snip...)

(C1) plot3d(x+y,[x,-3,3],[y,-3,3]);

*** - FUNCALL: the function POLYGON-PTS is undefined
1. Break [1]> :q
(C2) load("plot.lisp");
;; Loading file plot.lisp ...
;; Loading of file plot.lisp is finished.
(D2)                               plot.lisp
(C3) plot3d(x+y,[x,-3,3],[y,-3,3]);



     and everything appears all right. Looks (but I am not any lisp
xprt) a compilation (clisp-related) problem?

      In any case, this is not urgent for me (I use maxima for other
things), but maybe it is for the package.

I've seen this with CMUCL as well.  If you look in plot.lisp, you'll
see the defstruct for polygon is wrapped inside an eval-when.  Move it
outside the eval-when and recompile.  Plotting should work now.  At
least it does on CMUCL.

Message-ID: <4nofmv6eh3.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

revert and revert2 in share2/revert.mc don't work.

The easy way to make it work is to change the case of the entire file
to be all upper (or lower) case.  It uses mixed case for some vars
which are now different vars in maxima.

I suspect all the files should be converted to a consistent case, if
they aren't already.

Yes this is 99.9% true. But even to compile Maxima from
current cvs HEAD on clisp one need to edit few lines of
code. Why don't make Maxima to work with clisp out of the
box? And I want all features - debugger, all tests,
on line info help, plots and without any "unknown function"
calls.

Did you ever try using the regexp library directly from glibc (that
many CMUCLs have already linked anyway)? What's good is that the user
won't have to look for regex 0.12 - and you don't have to take care
about relinking regex when you restart a core.

The bad thing is that the regex inside some glibc is broken in the
sense that it chokes when searching for a very simple regex "^L^_" in
one of the info files. I was able to work around doing these few
searches directly in lisp. 

This in turn made me think that maybe one should get rid of the regex
part entirely - any idea how hard that would be?  Getting into the
user interface issue - an alternative path is to beef up some emacs
interface to use emacs' info directly.

(I don't understand the question, sorry...) I can compile all
maxima and run the tests without any error, but when I try to
plot3d something, I get that error. Now it is solved thanks to
Osman.

The problem is in src/plot.lisp, the definition of polygon
is in an

(eval-when ...)

loop, and this prevents its proper functioning under clisp.

This can be mended taking the def. of polygon out of that
eval-when.

Thanks for the concern,

	Pedro.

Yes, but didn't actually do it, mostly because I'm not sure Solaris
has exactly the same interface.  It shouldn't be too hard.  I also
thought about using one of the Lisp regex packages.  Never did
anything more than think about it though.

(P.S.  I fixed the bug that made info searches so much slower in clisp
and CMUCL.  It was using * when it should have been \*.  Ah, the fun
of reading someone else's hairy regexps using a different syntax!)

That's already taken care of in the init-maxima routine.

A broken glibc is a good reason to use GNU regex.  If people think
this is worth having, I see no reason why it can't be added as part of
maxima's source, just like gmp has been added.

Probably not too hard as long you're careful in writing the texi
files.  The searches being done are usually fairly simple.  I think
the regexp's just add a bit of robustness when things are quite
what was expected.

At that point, I'd rather have maxima start up a browser to load up
the html version.

I agree. Several of us are working toward the goal of having everything
work correctly out of the box with clisp (and others ANSI CL's).

Well, it was Ray's idea. I had confirmed the problem. Now I can
report that it did solve the plot3d problem with clisp.

But it caused an initial stumbling block to me when I first tried to
restart my maxima core. As far as I remember, a failing dynamic link
gives an error different from FILE-ERROR

This is where I am confused as the regex.h that comes with glibc on my
Linux indicates that this is indeed version 0.12 GNU regex

And perhaps with a robust determination of whether the naive user has
installed regex 0.12, wants to use glibc's regex or omit it
all. As for my complaint about FILE-ERROR above, we might think about
distributing a sufficiently intelligent maxima.core...

OK, I uploaded a new pdf which uses the hyperref package to generate

from Lyx except to import the text examples.  The chapters are
different files, so people can make their own version of the main tex
file and include whichever chapters they like.  Also the pdf was
generated with pdflatex and uses jpegs rather than the converted eps

This is only for user manual stuff - the reference manual will be in

Message-ID: <1004135775.29796.61.camel@abacus>

Hi,

I would like to make several proposals for the Maxima project:

1) We have (a) a project coordinator, (b) a content referee and (c) an
infrastructure referee. The referees would have final say on what goes
into CVS, but would not necessarily be the ones doing the work. 

2) I volunteer to be project coordinator and infrastructure referee. I
am actually doing infrastructure work right now and intend to continue
to do so. My real interests lie in the content, but I think the current
infrastructure needs to be improved to the point where it no longer gets
in the way of the content.

3) I nominate Richard Fateman to be content referee.

4) The the next steps in the Maxima project should be as follows:

a) Maxima CVS moves to sourceforge.

b) Call the current version Maxima 5.6 Beta. Incorporate whatever
hacks/bug fixes people have been sending to the mailing list since
Schelter passed away. Disallow new features.

c) There is no 5.6 Final release.

d) Incorporate new build system when I am done with it. Clean up
package. Call the new version Maxima 5.9. The purpose of this release is
to act as a beta release for the first major release of the new Maxima
project, 6.0.  Focus for 5.9 should be the shift to parity among ANSI
Common Lisp implementations.

e) Bang on bug fixes in Maxima 5.9 series. Add new tests. Continue to
disallow new features. Add new Maxima documentation.

f) Release Maxima 6.0 when we are satisfied that it is clean and stable.

g) Create Maxima 6.1 branch for new features. Keep stable 6.0 branch
with bug fixes only.

h) Attempt to get better publicity for Maxima when it reaches 6.0.

Thanks, the start seems to be fine!
And LaTeX is the right source format for

It seems like a nice plan to me. I'm willing to take part in testing,
cleaning and fixing bugs.

And some proposals about infrastructure.

1) Right now Maxima uses files with so many various extensions
- .dm .dem .dm1 .dm2 .dmt .lsp .lisp .mc .mac - too many!
It is good idea to standardize this better
and reduce the number of file extensions to, say,
.mac .lisp .usg .mac .dem.

2) The directory structure isn't very logical to me as well. Contributed
packages now go into share, share1, share2, sharem, tensor, sym ...
This ought to be reorganized somehow. For example, one
directory share with subdirectories - one subdirectory for each
contributed package or particular application area.

3) Contributed packages should not be installed as source code (.mac .lisp)
but compiled during installation process and finally installed as  .o or
.fas
(background lisp dependent).

There are a few suffixes that make sense though I don't know what
the ones above mean, entirely.  Some of them seem to come from
shortening 3 or 4 letter suffixes to 2 for purposes of storing with
weak file systems.
Here is what comes to my mind
.cl  for a file that is in common lisp. Thus .lsp, .lisp, .l
      could be changed to .cl . Advantages: common usage, I think
      and only 2 letters. Does anyone else use this?
.mc  (is that in use already?) for a file that is in
      the "macsyma" language. e.g.  foo(x):=x+1
      Since the demo files are also in this language, we could
      still use it.
.fasl conventional name for compiled version of .cl file
       perhaps .o if that is what CLISP or ... provides.
.doc  maybe more of these variations... documentation of some
       sort.

There may be some more,  but I can imagine a situation
in which we have
foo.mc    source code   foo(x):=x+1
foo.cl    result of translating (by the TRANSLATE command)
           of  foo.mc into common lisp
foo.fasl  result of compiling into machine code foo.cl
foo.doc   the documentation e.g.  "foo" takes one argument...

There might also be other files, perhaps...

foo.info or foo.index  meta-data about foo, generated by the compiler
          or automatic processing of foo.doc??

fooaux.c  C code to make foo run faster
fooaux.o   compiled fooaux
fooaux.sl  shared library?

foodemo.mc  "basic" demonstration of the foo package
foodemo1.mc  more advanced ....

There are many other parts of a project that I do not
understand, but that are made by allegro common lisp
on windows. including
system.dll
system.lpr
system.exe
system.bil

...........

Note that programs initially written in common lisp would
not have a foo.mc version.

The reason there is share, share1, ... is, I think, that on the
PDP-10 ITS system on which Macsyma was first written in 1968, there
was a limit to the number of files in a directory, and furthermore,
directories were flat. Not hierarchical.  Thus when share got
nearly full, another directory, share1 was started up. I think that
the "subject" directory structure could be taken from (for example)
Mathematica.  While someone is looking at this, it might also
be reasonable to totally remove the file-name handling of Macsyma,
and just use common lisp's file name search-path, library-directory
etc. The Macsyma system's version was a synthesis of several
now dead conventions (ITS-PDP6/10, Multics, Lisp Machine).

sometimes the .mac code will not translate/compile correctly into
machine code.  The .mac  or .mc files should be available, and sometimes
it may be necessary to load them.

These days all filesystems in common use allow long filenames. I'd
like to see a move back at least 3-letter suffixes, and not shorten
4-letter words: mac doc demo lisp info etc

I guess you're asking if .cl is in use for other purposes. I don't
know, I'd prefer .lisp for common lisp source code - this is in wide
use. Admittedly, .cl has some use though.

> .fasl conventional name for compiled version of .cl file

.x86f and .sparcf to mention a few... On installed versions, these
should go somewhere that the user won't have to worry about them.

.info should imply a file in the info format.

A while ago CY asked about this. I was looking at my old Macsyma quick ref 
sheets and a sale pitch booklet that had a nice solution. Here it is:

load(vect);
scalefactors([[r*sin(p)*cos(q),r*sin(p)*sin(q),r*cos(p)],r,p,q]);
depends(t,[r,p,q]);
express(laplacian(t));
ev(d6,diff);
ratexpand(d9);

It looks like vect package is quite good. The Macsyma example involved 
Maxwell's equations.

Just wanted to pass this info along.

Personally I like .cl for Maxima's Common Lisp code. But Common Lisp
has a large heritage. Hundreds of programs are written in
Common Lisp. Is .cl really  in use among CL programs?  If  not then
changing .lisp -> .cl might be misleading.

Right now Maxima uses .mc and .mac for maxima code.
And actually in current Maxima source tree you can find
files with other extensions (even .txt)  which are turned out to be
Maxima code. I think we should choose one variant.
This is certainly a large work and it must be thoroughly
planned but proposed Maxima 5.9 seems like a good
stage to do such reorganization to make clean background
for future development.

This is background Lisp dependent. Installation scripts
for particular Lisp system or binary package packager must take
care about it.

Right now such documentation is in .usg files. I do not mind
changing extension to another one but .doc now is mostly
associated with MS Word files even in Unix world.

Well, I admit this. But such situation should be treated as exceptional
case rather than general rule. And source code is always readily available
since Maxima is open source software. To an user source code should go into
another package (say maxima-src) and installed on demand.

My thoughts are exactly like yours. If we are going to install source
for contributed packages then why do not install whole Maxima
sources? But this is too much for common user.
It seems to me that standard installation should install compiled
files only. Maxima is the open source software and anyone who
cares can dig into corresponding .tar.gz or src.rpm package.

Greetings!  Good to hear so much interest in the future of maxima!

I think the proposal below is great!  Here is some more info:

1) I think I started this thread a few weeks ago, and have since been
   away from my mail.  Early on, someone indicated that RMS had called
   for new maintainers of gcl and maxima.  I wrote him to see if he
   had any replies.  He said he had not, and asked if I was
   interested.  I replied that I was, but did not feel that I was the
   best qualified, and asked for some time to discuss on this list to
   see if someone else wanted to step forward.  I told him that if
   there was no one, I would do what I could rather than see the
   project languish.

2) We need to get back to him with the name of the official GNU
   maintainer.  James or Richard, if either of you are so willing,
   please say so and I'll pass you name on to RMS.  Of the three roles
   James outlined, the 'project coordinator' should probably be the
   official GNU maintainer.  If either of you are unwilling for any
   reason, then I will volunteer with RMS, unless someone else steps
   forward in the next few days.

3) If you need me in any capacity, I'm willing to help, but most
   likely have less available time and applicable experience than
   several others on this list.  Here is the experience I can offer:

	a) skills in math at the level of a Ph.D. in theoretical
	   physics 
	b) maintained the Debian maxima package for about 1.5
	   years,
	c) pretty good with C/gdb/assembly, 
	d) have a reasonable amount of experience porting and
	   packaging for Debian
	e) had worked briefly with Dr. Schelter on fixing segfaults
	   and getting stripped dynamic binaries 
	f) registered at sourceforge, could setup the project
	   there if current site or a new one is desired.
	g) little lisp experience
	h) little time

4) Here is the list of those who have expressed interest in
   helping with maxima.  In addition to those who have posted to the
   list (and have been previously compiled by Cliff, thanks!), a few
   have contacted me via private email.  

	James Amundson      amundson at fnal.gov
	Richard Fateman     fateman at cs.berkeley.edu

	Detlev Zundel       detlev.zundel at stud.uni-karlsruhe.de
	Camm Maguire        camm at enhanced.com
  

Suggestions:

1) We should separate the list into a user's list and a developer's
   list.  Whoever serves as project coordinator should contact the
   people listed above and get their permission to subscribe them to
   the developer's list.   The lists can be setup at sourceforge.

2) Is anyone interested in working on gcl?  I am happy to offer what
   help I can here as well, especially as it appears that maxima will
   work best with gcl for at least the near future.  A person familiar
   with the common lisp standard would be extremely helpful :-)

3) Personally, I think it very important that maxima remain fully
   functional in the absence of commercial, closed or proprietary
   systems.  Not that these systems could not be used when available,
   of course.  There are many symbolic math systems available in the
   proprietary world, but to my understanding maxima is the best and
   perhaps only one available for the education and empowerment of the
   public at large.  So perhaps we should put in place some system
   that makes sure new development works with the freely-available
   tools.

The Allegro common lisp that I use seems to think that if you
say (load "foo") it should look for files
foo
foo.cl
foo.lsp
foo.lisp
     so there is no univeral standard.  I personally use .cl,
and I think that Franz Inc uses .cl as well..
but common lisp can be set up to check out lots of suffixes.

How can I do inverse laplace transformation with maxima?

I'm afraid maxima can't do that. :-(

Hi Richard,
 Yes it can. use ILT :

(C4) ilt(s/(1+s^2),s,t);
 
(D4)                                COS(t)

I was planning to contact RMS to tell him that I will become the new
maintainer, but I thought I'd wait a couple of days in order to let
people have a shot at disagreeing with my proposal in serious way.

I also need to contact the current owner of the Maxima sourceforge
project and the sysadmin at Texas.

Two lists is a good idea. We already getting quite a bit of developer

I think serious consideration should be given to letting GCL wither
away. (Please feel free to disagree.) We aren't that far away from
getting Maxima to work well with ANSI Common Lisps. There are already a
number of serious Lisp people working on CLISP, CMUCL and SBCL. Perhaps
Lisp maintenance efforts would be better spent there.

I've posted a similar message before, but I didn't get any answer yet.

Given the lack of documentation about the Maxima source itself, and since I
don't know Common Lisp at all, I'm asking you what are the requirements to
have xmaxima running and plotting features working.

Using Clisp, I could get a command-line only maxima for Mac OS X, now that
there's an Aqua native port of tcl/tk, I think it should be the time to have
xmaxima running on my system.

I'd appreciate for any piece of information or any help you could give.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <20011029080806.5790956c.daniel.duparc@free.fr>

Dear friends of maxima,

1. patch for mactex.lisp
------------------------
I did'nt succeed in patching any mactex.lisp:
the tex() command is always bad.
Would you please, Barton, put a good mactex.lisp
in a web (or ftp) site (or send it in this list:
suitably gzipped, it would be quite small...)

2. maxpage
-----------
Several messages in this list gave hints about
maxpage (from Bill and others...).
I've got 768MB ram but it seems that launching
./configure --enable-maxpage=128*1024
(512 MB for pages)
puts the compilation of gcl 2.3.8beta into
troubles in _some_ cases.
Does anybody know why?

How can I verify these tunings?

3. init.lsp
-----------
a) Is this the good location for it: 
/usr/local/lib/maxima-5.6/src/ 
if the lib for maxima was installed in 
"/usr/local/lib/maxima-5.6"?

b) Has anybody a _recommended_ init.lsp 
depending on maxpage? (Vadim?)

+ I don't know how to allocate a sufficiently large
bignum-stack (i. e., I think, for this gcl, a pari stack)
to compute 10000! without a further call to
:lisp(si::multiply-bignum-stack 100)
 
+ where is the documentation about these issues?
(everything in this message came from messages
in this list, not from the inner documentation)    

Best regards.

Message-ID: <F5FEAC407A690E42BD26E4F1453019422BEFBB@esebe002.NOE.Nokia.com>

Hello,

is there an easy way to get a list of all words, which Maxima recognizes or
uses for its own purposes?
As I understand, Maxima keywords are automatically converted to upper-case,
for example

sin+sinc => SIN+sinc after evaluation.

What I need is a command / function, which returns a list of all registered
keywords: [ABSBOXCHAR,ACOS,ACOSH,ACOT,...].
(I could get most of them from the manual index, but some packages - for
example 'Format' - define their own keywords).

I am planning to implement a simple 'syntax-highlighting' mechanism in
Symaxx.

Regards

Markus

As a matter of fact, yes. I was interested in that for getting the
list of candidate keywords for readline completion, and Dr. Schelter
suggested me the way. I'm not sure whether I tested this with Maxima
or just with Gcl, but it should work with both. The bad thing is,
that if I understood correctly sloop is special to Gcl and not Common
Lisp.

Anyway, here's the relevant part of my readline-patch:

+; init Readline word completion list for Gcl
+ (if (fboundp 'si::readline-init)
+       (let (l)
+               (sloop::sloop for v in-package 'lisp do
+                       (if (or (boundp v) (fboundp v))
+                               (setq l (cons (symbol-name v) l))))
+               (sloop::sloop for v in-package 'keyword do
+                       (if (or (boundp v) (fboundp v))
+                               (setq l (cons (format nil ":~A" v) l))))
+               (si::readline-init t "Gcl" 1 l)))

This reads the keyword list to "l". The first line checks if the
underlaying Lisp system supports the subroutine "si::readline" init,
and if so it builds the keyword list and calls the subroutine.

Looks great, althought I didn't read it that carefully.
One typographic note, I think you should make the images
little bit smaller.

I think we should avoid .doc. It's commonly used to encode
certain type of not-human-readable binary files.

Certainly GCL should not be damped on purpose, but I worry that this will
happen "automatically" unless we'll find a person(s) who is willing
to support GCL (I already can't rebuild GCL after recent Linux upgrades).
I'm not so optimistic about this. Personally I'm interested in developing
Maxima not any particular Lisp system.

Yes, I agree with this, especially as there are IMHO better lisp
systems than GCL (e.g CMUCL and clisp, not to speak of the commercial
ones).
I think we should concentrate on bringing Maxima to the world of ANSI
complying Common Lisp, with as few idiosyncrasies as possible. This
is, I think, the best way tu guarantee that Maxima will survive, not
to speak of prospering.

I think that Bill Schelter worked pretty hard at
integrating the Maxima-GCL-Tcl/TK-C interface; he
also may have had some insight as to why his
continued support of GCL was better than going to
CMUCL and CLISP  (other than the natural inclination
we all have to avoid NIH [Not Invented Here]).

I guess what we've seen is that the default handling
of growing a larger heap space in GCL is not right
for Maxima, given certain problems.  And that rebuilding
on some new systems causes problems.
  1. Do we know that the growing of larger heap space
is an inherent problem, or just related to our inability
to configure it?
  2. Do we know that CMUCL and CLISP are better in
this regard?

I think other issues include portability to other
platforms (Mac, various UNIX e.g. Sun Solaris, HP-UX,
BSD-UNIX.. not just one Linux).


I guess I do not have a specific proposal here if we
somehow decide GCL should be maintained, but no one
will volunteer to do it!  (Pay someone?)

For CMUCL, the heap space size is fixed at startup to a fairly large
size of 512 MB or so.  Once started, you can't change it, but it can
be changed via a command-line option up to some platform-specific
maximum. 

I don't think CMUCL has any problems on allocating objects from the
heap, as long as you don't exceed the heap size.  CMUCL on x86 has a
generational GC that can be tuned in some ways.  This might help make
maxima run faster.

Diversity is good.  Sorry, I can't volunteer to maintain it.

It seems to me that the material which is
the input/output transcript should be displayed in one
of the more advanced display systems.  Using the ascii-based
display means that the material takes too much room and
is hard to read.

  When I last tried to make such documentation I was
faced with the same situation, and I think I also used
ascii text.

  The fact that you are still doing this suggests several
things.
1. The advanced front end (Texmacs looks best)
are not good enough to support
what you want.  (No cut and paste of typeset expressions?)
2. The displays don't reflect accurate or fully
functional formatting,
for example, does Texmacs handle multiple line displays?

I am trying to get Texmacs installed (a student is
working on it... it seems ok on Solaris; I use maxima on
windows though!)
Also texmacs seems not at all like emacs to me, which
is a disappointment..  I wanted all of emacs + display sections
in a notebook.

Actually, I didn't use TeXmacs because I figured ascii was the most
universal (Windows users currently only have xmaxima, so they don't get
any of the formatted stuff).  I think we could include texmacs sessions
instead, if that seems better to everyone.

I believe it does, but I'm not sure how well.  The person who wrote the
interface I believe said it needs more work before it's really robust. 
I know it crashes and burns if you try to load the file used for make
test stuff.  Other than that, it has done ok in the limited trials I
have put it through.

That's the problem - we have no good universal interface that can do
what TeXmacs can do.  We have a lot of work to do before we are ready
to think about that problem - it will be highly nontrivial no matter
how we look at it, and my guess is that a really well done interface
will involve writing bindings for some universal graphical toolkit. 
(TCL/TK just doesn't do it, for me anyway.)

Hmm...  well, you could ask the developer of TeXmacs about that, and
see what he says.  I don't know that much about it.

That's my goal - as soon as we get the sourceforge stuff set up, I'll
upload the latex source into it.  Then we can really start to go to
town.  This is most definitely not a one man effort - I just wanted to
have a framework in place, to give direction to the documentation
effort.  I think we've got that now, so I'm ready to open it up and beg
for help :-)

Yeah, actually I guess latex was complaining to me about that.  I'll
see if I can shrink them without distorting them too much.

Other comment on PDF of manual


I think when we write a manual it tends to reflect things
that we found interesting, or things that the WRITER found challenging.
It doesn't necessarily mean that the same things will
be interesting or important to the READER.

With this in mind, you might consider whether discussing
::  deserves so much space.  I've used Macsyma for many
years, and I doubt that I found use for it more that once.

Keeping in mind the READER's perspective is important.

GCL 2.4.0 does not build on hpux anymore :-(  HPUX support was
nonexitent anyways. Bill did not know and the initial port was done by 
someone who is not involved with hpux anymore. 2.3.8 works ok. 

I am in favor of maintaining/strengthening  CLISP build. Seems to work 
on any platform. If you need speed, maybe you'll need to buy a
commercial common lisp implementation or be lucky  cmucl/sbcl
working on your platform.

Very true.  OK, I'll tone that section down.  That's one of the reasons
I'm eager to open up this thing - so we get more opinions.  That means
all you newbies out there too - your feedback will be especially
important, since the basics chapter is aimed at you in particular. 

Thanks, Richard, for the heads up.

I've wondered about this point - CLISP is slow, granted, but maybe we
could work with them to find and remove the bottlenecks?  There seems
to be much to recommend CLISP if it weren't for the speed issue.  We
have gcl and cmucl to refer to when suggesting to them what the
bottlenecks are to remove.

Clisp programs are slower since clisp's compiler do not produce
native machine code but rather some special portable code (.fas files).
This approach is more flexible but obviously less efficient.
So this is design concept and can't be easily changed.

If you have Maxima+clisp running in text mode and tcl/tk then
just start
  xmaxima -lisp clisp
or just
  xmaxima
provided command
  maxima
executes Maxima under clisp.

However, if there is a particular Common Lisp function or set of
Common Lisp functions that are the bottle neck it might be possible to
get the Clisp folks to implement them in C as is done for many, many
Common Lisp functions now.

I doubt there is such a thing, though, or they are already implemented
in C.

Do you mean that with 128*1024 compilation
sometimes succeed but sometimes not?
What are the error messages about?

Why not. But it seems that GCL/Maxima loads init.lsp
only from current working directory or if explicitly
requested by appropriate command line parameter.

I don't have it. GCL has quite complex memory
allocation system. It splits memory in several
independent areas and  it is hard to make any
universal layout. Optimal memory allocation
in GCL seems to be problem dependent (do you
need many large bignums or lots of list nodes).
This is my practical experience so far
but actually I'm not 100% sure that I'm correct.
Maybe the right way is to tune automatic new
memory allocation using allocate-growth rather
than preallocate large amount of RAM on
start up.

All memory allocation functions are described in

Attached is my mactex.lisp file; it includes all of my patches and
Judah Milgram's patch for log-like functions.

1.  un-gzip mactex-1.7.lisp.gz;  it contains only one file, mactex.lisp.

2.  If there is a mactex.lisp file in maxima's src directory, rename
    it. (Call it anything).

3.  copy mactex.lisp to maxima's src directory.

3.  Try it out:

(C10) tex(a+b/c);
$${{b}\over{C}}+a$$
(D10) FALSE

If this doesn't work, you may need to load mactex: (here I'm on a windows
machine).

(C11) load(mactex);
Loading C:/maxima/src/mactex.lisp
Finished loading C:/maxima/src/mactex.lisp
(C12) tex(coth(x));
$$\coth x$$

(C13)

I hope this 9751 byte attachment doesn't bother anyone?

Thank you very much. But after installation
and recompilation of maxima, nothing was changed!

I think that my problem need to be explained,
since it may be usefull for somebody else: 
actually I succeeded in patching 
(by hand) the mactex-1.6 that was in the cvs tree.

But when launching 
./configure 
make
make install
the file mactex.o _was not_ changed, so the
previous errors were remaining!

I deleted the old mactec.o and it was recompiled
after your source and everything is now allright.

Best regards.

Well, I have made somme progress :

(C1) plot_options;

(D1) [[x, - 3, 3], [y, - 3, 3], [GRID, 30, 30], [VIEW_DIRECTION, 1, 1, 1], 

[COLOUR_Z, FALSE], [TRANSFORM_XY, FALSE], [RUN_VIEWER, TRUE], 

[PLOT_FORMAT, OPENMATH], [NTICKS, 100]]

/* notice : openmath */

(C2) paramplot(cos(x),sin(x),[0.0,6.29]);

then a file maxout.ps is generated, with a beautiful
circle.

However, I failed in changing the ouput to openmath 
or gnuplot. 

Best regards.

Subject: [Maxima] CLISP problem
Message-ID: <15327.64400.808895.341142@c1406.ae.ge.com>

Hello,

I found the Lie symmetry package symmgrp.max and after uppercase'ing
it and the *.dat files, it worked with maxima-5.5 with gcl. Maxima5.6
would only build under clisp on hpux10.20. So I tried running the
the test cases. All worked OK except the largest (s_kar1.com).
 After taking long time, it crashed with saying that it 
could not take CAR of LAMBDA. I checked that both clisp and gcl does
not take CAR of ATOMs. I think there may still be something wrong with 
the CLISP Maxima. Maybe related to memory since smaller examples work
OK. Anyway, once the cvs on sourceforge is up we can put the
symmgrp.max there since it is working with gcl. There are pretty good
docs/papers that come with the package.

My guess is that somewhere within maxima there is a plain lambda expression
that should have been wrapped inside a (coerce <s-expr> 'function)
that isn't.

In CLtL1, which gcl supports, a list starting with LAMBDA is a
function.  That's no longer true, I think, for Common Lisp.  

This isn't easy to find because maxima often builds these functions
using (list 'lambda <stuff>).

Perhaps a backtrace from clisp will point to where the problem is?

Subject: [Maxima] Update
Message-ID: <1004540016.2279.15.camel@abacus>

Here's an update on what I have done this week.

1) Created a plan for the cvs module. In case you didn't know, CVS is
notoriously bad at dealing with file renaming and rearrangement. Here is
my plan to get around this: Import the existing Maxima repository under
module name "maxima-pre59". When we are ready to create the 5.9 release,
re-import it under the name "maxima" with the files renamed and moved by
hand. I know how to do this; I have been a CVS administrator.

2) Contacted Steve Horne about the Maxima sourceforge site. Steve has
added me as an administrator. Thank you, Steve.

3) Contacted Maorong Zou about the existing Maxima cvs repository. Got
the cvs tree from him. Thank you, Maorong.

4) Contacted Richard Stallman. Really, I made contact with his automatic
mail system, which warned me that it takes a while to get a reply from
RMS. Haven't heard from the actual person yet.

5) Contacted Sourceforge to make sure I can do what I need for (1)
within their system. They responded positively, and, I might add, almost
instantaneously. This is my first dealing with Sourceforge at the admin
level. So far, I am very impressed by their responsiveness.

I should be able to import the cvs repository in the next couple of
days.

While my opinion is quite uneducated, I must say that I also have a
positive bias toward gcl, in part because of Dr. Schelter's hard work,
in part because of the numerous benchmarks posted here which seems to
show gcl always coming out on top, and in part because of its close
connection with gcc and its compilation strategy into C code.

If indeed gcl offers certain features which are unique/superior to
other free alternatives out there, then I for one would be interested
in helping maintain it, perhaps even coordinating the project.  But I
really don't have enough info to make a fair comparison.  Would some
kind knowledgeable soul provide a feature/performance summary of
cmulisp, clisp, and gcl, and post here?

Thanks!

I hope I didn't sound too discouraging about becoming the new maintainer
for GCL in my previous post on the subject. I really only wanted to
start a discussion.

I have a very preliminary set of benchmarks, subject to the following
disclaimers:

0) REALLY BIG DISCLAIMER: I didn't do these tests under controlled
conditions. The results, however, are qualitatively consistent with what
I have seen in the past. Nonetheless, they should be treated with some
skepticism.

1) I don't think these are particularly good. benchmarks. I think it
would be really useful to hear what sort of real calculations people
have done where speed really mattered. I don't have any examples handy.

2) I only consider speed, not memory usage.

The system:

My 900MHz Linux machine.

The benchmarks:

1) expand((x+y+z)^300)$

2) Run the entire maxima test suite.

Subject: [Maxima] User Manual
Message-ID: <OF717D07AA.0E890840-ON86256AF6.0053E68B@unk.edu>

After volunteering to write a section for the "User Manual" on the
special function package, I started thinking about how to best
present maxima examples in TeX.  A few thoughts on the possibilities:

i) Use maxima ASCI-art math.  This is the honest approach because
it what most users will see on the screen; however, it looks 1970-ish,
takes up  too much space, and it is easily messed up (an extra space
here or a tab converted to spaces).

ii) Use TeXMacs. TeXMacs doesn't do windows and those of us who have
used TeX for fifteen plus years aren't too excited about it either.
I think we'd get more volunteers for the "User Manual" if we used
standard LaTeX. Additionally, I think currently TeXMacs is missing
too much of LaTeX and is too flaky to use  on a large document.

An idea:  Embed maxima in LaTeX something like:

Let {\tt buddy} be the gradient of $x^2 + y^2$.  Thus
\begin{maxima}
  buddy : [diff(x^2 + y^2,x), diff(x^2 + y^2,y)];
  solve(buddy,[x,y]);
\end{maxima}

Write a LaTeX pre-processor that would scan a LaTeX file for
embedded maxima, extract the maxima commands, have maxima
evaluate them, TeX the output and appropriately replace the
\begin{maxima} ...  \end{maxima} with TeX code.   A document
written  this way would more maintainable than one done by cutting
and pasting from either TeXMacs or from ASCII-art.

What do you all think?

Agreed.

I've looked at this a little, and I agree.  My though had been to run
the maxima sessions in TeXmacs, export to LaTeX, and cut and paste, but
unfortunately it isn't even that simple - the generated LaTeX is quite
odd, and depends on a special TeXmacs style file which causes some
problems with the current docs.  So that particular method is out.

That would be absolutely ideal.  Also, it would have the added
advantage of automatically keeping the documentation honest - i.e., we
could just recompile the docs using a new maxima, and we could see if
any of the old examples no longer work with the new system.  

One thing we would have to be careful of, though, would be graphical
output.  It will be awhile before we have to worry about that, but we
need to make sure we get eps plots back in all cases, or at least
handle the other cases in some intelligent way.
Another thing would be the startup message, telling which versions of
Lisp and Maxima are being used - we would need to decide how to tell
the particular session whether or not to include it.  Also, would we
want to be able to do regular tex and a single maxima session mixed,
i.e.:


 Let {\tt buddy} be the gradient of $x^2 + y^2$.  Thus

 \begin{maximasession}

 \begin{maxima}
    buddy : [diff(x^2 + y^2,x), diff(x^2 + y^2,y)];
    solve(buddy,[x,y]);
 \end{maxima}

 Now let's integrate {\tt buddy}:

 \begin{maxima}
    integrate(buddy,x);
 \end{maxima}

 \end{maximasession}

That way, we could dictate not only when we had maxima commands to
evalutate, but we could denote when we wished to start a new session
and when we want to use the same session despite having put our own TeX
stuff in between some lines of Maxima output.


In any case, if it can be done, your approach gets my vote hands down. 
Problem is, I've no idea how to write a LaTeX preprocessor.  Are you
volunteering to do it? :-)

Dan Dill once wrote a Mathematica mode for emacs, which included a
notebook interface.  I adapted it for MuPAD, and it does pretty much
what you describe.
If there is interest, I could fairly easily get it working for Maxima.

I think one of graphicx or ps packages does some kind of such parsing
to figure out how to dimension the space for the image.

However, since my usage of maxima is either via the command line or
via XEmacs, I rather like to see exactly what maxima is going to print
out.

I guess it really depends on whether the we expect the user reading
the manual is using the command-line or xmaxima or some other GUI.

The reference manual, when in ps or PDF form, however, should include
TeX instead of ASCII art do describe the functions.  There's no reason
not to.  (My simple elliptic functions texinfo documentation currently
does that.  When rendered as an info file, you get ASCII art, but nice
formulas when rendered in Postscript or PDF.)

That would be superb! We have many "flyers" on Macsyma written

them into the new "Maxima Manual" and would be nice to have that
in place before making this conversion.

For the reference manual, I agree that sounds good.  I don't think the
User Manual will be rendered as an info document, however - that's not
really it's purpose.

What we are discussing here is just for the User Manual.  The reference
manual is another breed of cat, so to speak, which will do (does) a
different job.  The reference manual we can treat as online help,
readable from any interface. The user manual is not intended to be read
from the command line.

I understand that, but you didn't comment on the stuff I wrote above
that.  Silence means yes, right? :-)

I think I've made a valid comment about the user manual.  I am using
the command-line interface, so I'd like the user manual to reflect
what I would see with that interface.  But perhaps the typical person
reading the user manual will use one of the GUI interfaces, and the
manual should reflect that perhaps.

It is a good point, in fact, that's why I originally did it that way. 
However, there might be another way.  What about, when we interface
LaTeX with maxima, we include a global setting, which can be overridden
locally, about whether or not maxima should return TeX formatting or
regular?  I don't know enough about LaTeX to know if this can be done,
but presumably when the preprocessor calls maxima, it will be telling
maxima to give it TeX back.  Maybe we could include an option to the
maxima environment, say 

\usepackage{maxima}[notex]

which would have the preprocessor not ask for tex and instead format
the returned output the way it is currently done.  That way, those who
use the command line interface could add the [notex] toggle once, run
latex/pdflatex and get what they want.  Would that work?

I'm undecided on whether the User Manual should have ASCII-art math or
TeX'ed math.  I think ASCII-art math it is bad for the reasons in my
original posting,  but, as I said, it is the honest approach.

I hope Maxima will someday have a spiffy user interface that
provides TeX or TeX-like terminal output. When that day arrives
do we want  an ASCII-art User Manual?  In the meantime, I like
CY's idea of being  able to optionally specify TeX or ASCII-art
Maxima output.

And I *really* like Jay Belanger's offer to get Dan Dill's Mathematica
mode for emacs working for Maxima.

Well, right now, TeXmacs does that.  (Symaxx does that to some extent,
also, but that's a different type of interface.)

Thanks (and to Paulo, too), I'll get to work on it.
The MuPAD version that I did could optionally give output in ascii or
TeX, the Maxima version should have this, also.

OK, Paul reminded me I haven't uploaded the source yet, so I've finally
got it up.  It's at
http://mathshield.sourceforge.net/maximausermanual.tar.gz and is about
700 odd Kilobytes.  The tex2pdf file is the script I use to generate
the thumbnailed pdf documents - it is written by Steffen Evers and is
under GPL.  So as soon as James is ready we can stick this sucker into
CVS, and everyone can start fixing all my bad LaTeX. :-)

Two things:

1) Should we stick the open content license on this, use GPL, or what?

2) I forgot to add a credits page - we should do that :-)

Thanks for this!  Can you repeat with the following command executed
first?  (Dr. Schelter did this on his benchmarks.)

:lisp (progn (allocate 'cons 8000 t) (allocate 'fixnum 1000 t) (si::allocate-relocatable-pages 2000 t))

This might level the playing field among systems starting out with
different amounts of memory allocated. 

Also, what about some other non performance issues?

1) fraction of common lisp standard implemented?
2) correctness?
3) compile process, i.e. to C, asm, other?
4) portability
5) license
6) stability
7) libraries or equivalent

Any info here much appreciated.  It makes no sense to waste effort
needlessly duplicating things, but it would also be a shame to throw
away something with possible advantages.

Thanks!

No, I can't. Why?
	1) The :lisp function uses evalhook, which is not part of the ANSI
standard, so CMUCL does not have it. This problem will have to be fixed
in the 5.9 series.
	2) Memory allocation functions are implementation dependent. I don't
know off the top of my head to do the equivalent things for clisp and
cmucl.

> This might level the playing field among systems starting out with

Like I said, the tests I did weren't controlled. I'd like to see a
better controlled set of benchmarks after we get a better controlled
version of Maxima.

> Also, what about some other non performance issues?
>

This is the big issue. clisp and CMUCL do a pretty good job of
implementing the ANSI CL standard. GCL has a couple of ANSI features,
but it is not an ANSI Common Lisp implementation. Period. Many, many
ANSI features are missing from GCL. This is my primary complaint against
GCL.

All of the following points are less important to me than this one.

Here is my limited understanding of these things

    Camm> 1) fraction of common lisp standard implemented?

GCL:  CLtL1 with some CLtL2 stuff perhaps.
Clisp:  purports to conform to ANSI Common Lisp
CMUCL/SBCL:  purports to conform to ANSI Common Lisp

    Camm> 2) correctness?

I think the all try to be correct, right?

    Camm> 3) compile process, i.e. to C, asm, other?

GCL:  compiles to C and runs a C compiler to get runnable code.
Clisp: compile to byte codes.
CMUCL: compiles to either byte codes or directly to native code.

    Camm> 4) portability

GCL: reasonably portable?
Clisp:  fairly portable
CMUCL:  very difficult to port

    Camm> 5) license

GCL:  GPL
Clisp: GPL
CMUCL: truly public domain

    Camm> 7) libraries or equivalent

What kind of libraries and how is that relevant to maxima?

I think if Maxima tries to only use ANSI common lisp things with,
perhaps some extensions so plotting, etc can be done, we don't have to
worry about what the underlying lisp is.

Insisting that the underlying CL be ANSI will
not solve ALL porting problems, since some of the code in Maxima
is not and cannot be ANSI -- there are pieces that we use that have
not been standardized.  Thus foreign function code is
not in ANSI.  I'm not sure what else we really need that
is not specified in ANSI CL.  Does anyone have a list?

Optimization of elaborate systems (GC tuning) is probably
outside the scope of the ANSI standard too...

I didn't mean to imply that everything would work if it were all
ANSI.  But core Maxima would probably work if that were true.  The
fancy stuff would have to be implementation specific.

As far as I know, Maxima wants access to the shell environment
variables and wants to be able to run subshells for plotting.  There
are some assumptions that the file system looks somewhat Unix-like.
Can probably remove most of this dependency by using logical
pathnames. 

I don't think there's any foreign function code except for CMUCL to
get regexp support.  We can remove this and use some of the Lisp
regexp implementations out there, if necessary.

Message-ID: <3BE184D4.40807@ondelette.com>

Somehow, I have to disagree that the "typical person" using Maxima will 
using a GUI. Frankly, I've tried both, and I much prefer working in 
console. I simply open a console and type "maxima".

I'm not sure why you would want to document very much the GUI. It hasn't 
been very helpful to me. The only non trivial issue comes up with the 
plots, but gnuplot is much better at plotting (it gets the job done 
faster and without having to click and click with a mouse... loosing 
valuable time). Maxima is valuable, but in my experience, not because of 
its GUI, not because of the plotting.

I would build the documentation without reference to any GUI... and 
then, add a section on the GUI.

Just my two cents..

Let me first describe symptoms. During standard build
procedure make stage fails. raw_gcl builds and works OK.
saved_gcl also builds but with suspicious error messages
and result is not operational. saved_gcl can be
started and even performs some lisp operations but dumps
core on others. For example you can crash it by typing
any unbound variable. Bad saved_gcl later fails to compile
some additional modules (gcl-tk) and total make process
fails.

I build GCL on ALT Linux distributive (Mandrake derived
Russian distro) and everything was OK with GCL and Maxima
until I made some large system upgrade. The interesting point is that
I still can build GCL and Maxima on old unupgraded system
and run resulting binaries on new one without any trouble
I just can't build GCL on it. I do not know which part of the system
causes the conflict. I only know so far that this is not Linux kernel
and compiler (problem remains with both gcc 2.95.3 and 2.96).
My primary suspect is new glibc 2.2.4.
I also positive that problem is not due to my personal
occasional Linux misconfiguration since same trouble
is observed in Debian

Message-ID: <20011101211338.01f66577.daniel.duparc@free.fr>

Dear friends of maxima,

I noticed a bad way to quit maxima:
ctrl-z leaves saved-maxima in memory.

I performed several tests with intensive 
usage of the memory and was surprised to see
that there was lesser and lesser memory
available.

It is not visible under top, but launching
ps -ax gives the pid(s) of the many
saved-maxima, and then 
top -p theses_pids 
shows the amount of memory taken.

However, when exiting by quit(), there is 
no problem.

(operating system: Linux Mandrake 7.1)

Best regards.

Dear friends of maxima,

I compiled gcl-2.3.8 with
./configure --enable-maxpage=256*1024
then maxima (last version of cvs + several 
recent patches) with gcl-2.3.8

I verified that in the file 
/usr/local/gcl-2.3.8/h/cmpinclude.h
there is:
#define MAXPAGE 256*1024

However, I am quite puzzled by the following result
of the lisp command "room":

I'm not sure it will work in ANSI CL, but look in the

I tried loading it up and there is now some kind of name conflict
for functions that exist in "mma" and also in lisp, but
are different.  And, or, not.  If someone really wants to
use this, I can look at it again.  (I adapted pieces to
other uses but have not maintained this.)  There are notes
on compiling it in KCL, the predecessor to GCL.

I am pleased to announce that the Sourceforge Maxima CVS repository is
now up. You can get to it from the project page,

Members of this list who would like write access to the repository will
need to get a Sourceforge account.

It is my inclination to grant write access liberally. However, people
should discuss non-trivial changes *before* they are committed.

Is mockmma actually a working computer algebra system, or is it more of
a framework in which to try out new techniques for stuff?  Or, more to
the point, is there any way mockmma can be used to improve Maxima?
Earlier you mentioned you had a good start on Mathematica in Lisp,
which I'm assuming was mma, and I was wondering if there were abilities
there which would be worth including in Maxima.  For example, I'm
intrigued by mma's ability to parse Mathematica syntax - would it be
possible to add that ability to Maxima, at least where a valid mapping
can be made?

A long time ago I hacked at mma with clisp. I got this far:

I can send you my modifications (and instructions) if you are

Excellent!  Now we need to get a web page, maybe something a little
nicer than the original at UT?

I've already got one - I'm known on Sourceforge as starseeker.  There's
not much point in adding me, however, unless we also upload the
documentation - I'm not even close to being able to do anything useful
with Maxima itself.  Is that possible just by creating a new top level
directory in cvs and doing an update, or do we need to contact
sourceforge again?

We might want to be careful about this one - better that only the
people actually working on docs or code have access, just as a matter
of sound policy.

I'm curious - could you send them, or put them up on the web somewhere?
 If nothing else it should teach me a little about running lisp
programs.

I went there, registred and logged in, but I can't see any files ... 
either on the CVS tree or the Doc part of the Project ... am I missing
something ? Has the LaTeX file been uploaded already ?

I went over to OSWD and found a page which IMHO looks pretty nice -
I've got a version attached I customized for Maxima.  Anyone think it
might work OK as the homepage for the sourceforge site?

Design by Jonathan Sutherland
x3x93 at unb.ca
2000 - 2001


NOTE:

If you use, mod or hack this design, please give credit where credit
is due. Please include my name and email at the top of your code.


ABOUT dm:

dm [Digital Multiplex] was a small project I was working on in my
spare time during the summer of 2000. I stopped work on it as I
became more interested in going to the beach. I am now releasing
the design into the hands of the OSWD. Any comments or questions
can be directed to Jonathan at x3x93 at unb.ca.

To see what the site looks like with some graphics, please follow
the link below. The add banner at the top really screwed up my design.
However, I had managed to work around it before. Now, it just doesn't
look that good.

http://digitalmultiplex.hypermart.net


NOTES:

This site was designed with HomeSite using a tab setting
of 4 spaces. The HTML structure used has been proven by
and to myself as a very efficient method of organizing
the code.

Main page elements have three empty lines between them.
Tables within tables have two empty lines between them.
Tables and content elements have to emtpy lines between them.


TIPS:

* Drink water. Lots of water.
* Use a transparent pixel for architectural design.
* I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering student at UNB, and I am
  also pursuing a diploma in Technology Management and Entrepreneurship
  at the same time.

Now, send all your love/hate mail to x3x93 at hotmail.com :)

NOTES:

For browser discrepencies with the empty <td>'s listed below, it is

TITLE TABLE 

It's easy to make your title table look great. Put in some text using a simple, well
defined font in a color that matches the colors of your site. Check out the sites
below for some simple examples that turn out great. If your good at graphics, all the
better.

TIP: If you don't already, try designing your site in Photoshop or Paint Shop, then
go from there.

Subject: [Maxima] Off topic - Mockmma
References: <20011101214106.68919.qmail@web12208.mail.yahoo.com> <1004658063.17300.38.camel@abacus>

Well, you got about as far as you could, without defining
errorset, which is very handy but not in ANSI CL.  The
error handling functionality required for errorset is
far far simpler than ANSI provides.  Basically it does
  (ignore-error  <something to evaluate> )
At this point I suspect you've overcome nearly all
problems.


As for the more general question, can mockmma be used
with Maxima...
1. If someone has a text file in mathematica syntax,
it can be read into Maxima.  This will produce lisp
data that has to be massaged some to get it into
proper Maxima form, however.

Some of it cannot be put into Maxima form because there
is not an equivalent.  For example, the pattern expressions
in mathematica do not correspond in any simple way to
Maxima patterns.
 The commands etc are different, too.

2. If someone loves mathematica syntax
but dislikes the semantics, there is a framework in mockmma
for the real-eval-print loop on which one can hang various
pieces like a call to the maxima simplifier, integrator, display
etc.   (There is a rudimentary simplifier, integrator, display
and some other pieces supplied already; in particular a
polynomial manipulation package, a pretty-thorough imitation
of the mathematica pattern matcher, and maybe some interval
arithmetic stuff.)

For what it is worth, at least one company appears to have
taken this free code and written a computer-aided design
package on top of it.

Subject: [Maxima] using sum
Message-ID: <200111020456.fA24u2T16737@shadow.dvo.ru>

Hello


I am a novice with maxima and I am trying to study it.
Particularly I am interesting is it possible to operate
with indefinite sums in maxima, say to expand sum into series.
Something like this:

(C1) a:sum(exp(-(i+x)^(-2)),i,0,inf);

                                      1
                           INF   - --------
                              ====        2
                              \    (x + i)
(D1)                           >%E
                              /
                              ====
                        i = 0
(C2) taylor(a,x,0,5);

                                    1
                                  - --
                                     2
                                    x
(D2)/T/                         %E     + . . .
(C3) taylor(a,x,0,10);

TAYLOR unable to expand at a point specified in:
ERREXP1
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)

Subject: [Maxima] maxima on HP-UX/Digital Unix/Darwin(aka MacOS X)/Linux2.4
Message-ID: <3BE2466C.2789B876@kek.jp>

Hi,

I tried to compile latest version gcl and maxima on,
HP-UX 10.2/11.0 , OSF1(aka Digital Unix) V5.1 , Darwin(aka MacOS X 10.1)
and Linux 2.4. without any success , because of various reason.

 Q: Is there any documentation or note to port gcl/maxima on the
platform 
which is not supported in the current distribution?

Thank  you in advance,

for all fixed integer n>0,x->+0,Limit(%E^(-1/x^2)/x^n)is 0.
So,for all m,f(x):=%E^(-1/x^2),diff(f(x),x,m) is 0 at this point.
f(x) has not Taylor expansion at x=0.
As a matter of course, your (C2)has not effective Taylor expansion at x=0.
at (C1) you shoud rewrite i=1 from i=0.
But maxima can not taylor at x=0 because of sum(....,inf).

According your purpose,you write your new taylor  with Maxima or
a(n+1)-a(n)=f(x+1),laplace or Ztransform shoud be test,I think.


thanks.

I agree. To my experience text mode with decent command
line editing tools (e.g. readline) is often more convenient
than any GUI. I'm not against GIU and I prefer to have both
text and GUI modes.

It might be. These constants are set up by configure

Please tell me how you'll succeed in compiling gcl
on Mandrake 8.0. Which version of glibc do you have
in Mandrake 8.0?

I succeeded yesterday in compiling gcl-2.3.8
on Mandrake 8.0. I sent you a private e-mail
about that, but it was not clear (sorry).

./configure --enable-maxpage=128*1024
succeeded too, as reported by (room).

gcc was 2.96 and glibc 2.2.2

I did'nt built yet maxima, by lack of time.

Best regards.

Indeed, I was about to ask if have a volunteer to work on the web

I've added you to the developers list. I think you should check out the
maxima module and add your manual to the doc directory. The doc
directory will need some reorganization for 5.9, but we can worry about
that later.

Of course. I meant that people who want to work on the docs or code will
be given access without too much trouble.

I think the page looks great. It's a great start towards a new Maxima
site. Thanks a lot for working on this.

I've made some modifications to the text; they are attached. In
particular, I'd like to avoid discussing the why's of free software on
the front page. It is a subject that is covered in much more detail in
other venues.

I'd like to get the new web site up and running as soon as it is
complete. In the meantime, I've put a very simple Maxima home page at
maxima.sourceforge.net directing the viewer to the project page and the
mailing list. I think you can should put the site up at
maxima.sourceforge.net while it is under construction, but don't make it
the main page until it's ready.

Thanks again,
Jim

Design by Jonathan Sutherland
x3x93 at unb.ca
2000 - 2001


NOTE:

If you use, mod or hack this design, please give credit where credit
is due. Please include my name and email at the top of your code.


ABOUT dm:

dm [Digital Multiplex] was a small project I was working on in my
spare time during the summer of 2000. I stopped work on it as I
became more interested in going to the beach. I am now releasing
the design into the hands of the OSWD. Any comments or questions
can be directed to Jonathan at x3x93 at unb.ca.

To see what the site looks like with some graphics, please follow
the link below. The add banner at the top really screwed up my design.
However, I had managed to work around it before. Now, it just doesn't
look that good.

http://digitalmultiplex.hypermart.net


NOTES:

This site was designed with HomeSite using a tab setting
of 4 spaces. The HTML structure used has been proven by
and to myself as a very efficient method of organizing
the code.

Main page elements have three empty lines between them.
Tables within tables have two empty lines between them.
Tables and content elements have to emtpy lines between them.


TIPS:

* Drink water. Lots of water.
* Use a transparent pixel for architectural design.
* I am a fourth year Electrical Engineering student at UNB, and I am
  also pursuing a diploma in Technology Management and Entrepreneurship
  at the same time.

Now, send all your love/hate mail to x3x93 at hotmail.com :)

Ah, thanks. I was going to try to figure out how to replace errorset,
but hadn't really worked up the energy to do so yet. While I have the
both ANSI CL documentation and CLtL1, I often find it difficult to
figure out the ANSI CL replacements for CLtL-only functions. Any
pointers to replacing EVALHOOK? I think that's the biggest remaining
sticking point in getting Maxima to be fully working under ANSI CL.

I'm afraid there isn't much documentation on porting to new systems, at
least not yet. GCL is currently unmaintained. If you are having trouble
porting it for use with Maxima, you might be better off trying to build
Maxima with clisp. Unfortunately, that, too, is basically undocumented.
We are working hard to make Maxima build and operate cleanly with clisp
and other ANSI Lisps for the forthcoming 6.0 release, but we aren't
there yet.

In the meantime, to compile maxima with clisp, you should cd to the src
directory, type "make clisp-compile" then ask this list when you get
stuck.

Thank you very much for the reply/suggestion.
I also recived  suggestions/information from:
	Vitaly Lugovsky <vsl at ontil.ihep.su>,
	osman at fuse.net
	"Lizardo H. C. M. Nunes" <lizardo at urbi.com.br>
	David Bremner <bremner at unb.ca>.

 I will try maxima with CLISP on these platforms.

Thank you again for valuable comments.

Well, you are right. But I just want to note that Mathematica started gaining
market success in pre Mathematica 3.0 era when Mathematica 1/2
had no GUI but had quite good "readline" stile editing facilities.
Children may want use CAS to check their school math and they
certainly prefer GUI and book-style interface with all alphas
and betas nicely printed on screen. But I'm sure that people who
use CAS professionally for doing serious hard calculations
tend to use simple text console mode. The truth is that the
number of such professionals is rather small ;-(

Message-ID: <8D00C32549556B4E977F81DBC24E985D410053@crtsmail1.technol_exch.corp.riotinto.org>

Just a note to say that I have built clisp-2.27 on windows 2000 using
cygwin.  I was then able to compile a maxima, and it "sort of works".

 There were two minor problems.

configure detects IPv6 due to some incomplete headers in the cygwin
distribution.  This can be worked around by editing $(build)/unixconf.h and
replacing 
#define HAVE_IPV6 1
with
#undef HAVE_IPV6
A better solution would be to fix improve the IPv6 detection, as was done
for gcc-3


cygwin doesn't have getservent().  This was worked around by modifying
src/socket.d near line 847, changing 
#ifndef WIN32
to
#if !defined(WIN32) || ! defined (__CYGWIN__)
I guess an autoconf test for getservent() would be preferable.

The build then proceded normally.  

There was one testsuite failure in excepsit.erg.

hi Andrey

you wrote

It's OK. Unless sum has inf in expression.
eample
(C1) plot2d(sum(1/(x+i)^3,1,10),[x,0,10]);
plot2d(sum(1/(x+i)^3,1,inf),[x,0,10]) is not executable.


Your problem can be solve,a is converged uniformally
So change order operator sum ,taylor.
(C1) taylor(1/(1+x+i)^3,x,0,5)$
(C2) a:sum(%,i,1,inf)$
(C3) changevar(a,i+1-n,n,i);

We obtain answer for your problem,
ZETA(3)-1 -3(ZETA(4)-1)*x + 6(ZETA(5)-1)*x^2
-10(ZETA(6)-1)*x^3+15(ZETA(7)-1)*x^4-21(ZETA(8)-1)*x^5

Too noun expression obtained,example
(C5) taylor(limit(sum(1/(x+i+1)^3,i,1,p),p,inf),x,0,5);
but exact calc may need to change order two operator,as (C1)~(C3)

Of course set operations are part of it, but there is much more. All those 
functions to find, delete, replace elements in a sequence, Take a subseq, 
Fold with reduce, count the number of elements, Partition a sequence with 
overlapping and so on. 
I'm aware that I can call lisp functions from maxima, and I think that's 
nice. But I would prefer it maxima style.

It would be possible to add almost any of the lisp
commands to macsyma.  The basic notion of a macsyma
lisp  [a,b,c]
is internally  ((mlist simp) $a $b $c)

so you might convert that to a lisp
list  ($a $b $c), operate on it,  and then if
the result is a list, cons back the (mlist simp)
header.

This is tricky because if the result isn't a list of
expressions, but something like  ((mplus simp) $a $b $c)
then putting (mlist simp) on the front is not a good
idea.

Okay, it may still need some work, but it seems to be working.
(Not for XEmacs, if there is interest, I'll work on that.)
The version of Dan Dill's mode for Maxima is in the files
emaxima.el
emaxima.sty
maxima.el
maxima-font-lock.el
maxima-symbols.el
located at
ftp://vh213601.truman.edu/pub/Maxima/
The mode (EMaxima, a nice little pun) is basically a notebook
interface for Maxima, with some literate programming capabilities.
A brief intro is in EMIntro.ps, at the above site.

However, EMaxima has the input and the output separate.
For documenting actual sessions, I changed it around a bit, and I
think it does what Barton wanted the LaTeX-preprocessor to do.  The
resulting mode (MaximaDoc) is in
maximadoc.el
maximadoc.sty
maxima.el
maxima-font-lock.el
maxima-symbols.el
There is a brief intro at the top of maximadoc.el

maxima.el, maxima-font-lock.el and maxima-symbols.el are a version of
Bill Schelter's maxima-mode, that I changed quite a bit to make suit
my needs.  
J"urgen Tischer has made significant improvements to it, and now it
may well be worth checking out itself.

It works to me OK on Maxima 5.6 latest cvs + GCL 2.3.8.

Hello David,
What Linux distribution do you use? If it is one  with gcc-2.96 and >
then the problem may be due to compiler, did you try "make test", by the
way. You could recompile gcl and maxima with gcc-2.95(or with kgcc, e.g.)
in this case or use  gcl-2.3.8 as  Vadim.

best regards,
Valerij

I've noticed two more problems with Maxima under clisp.

(1) trigsimp(sin(x)^2+cos(2)^) fails.
This problem is fixed by replacing in
accordance with ANSI CL standard
special-function-p by special-operator-p.
special-function-p is obsolete.

(2) clisp based Maxima doesn't work with TeXmacs
out of the box.

Best regards,

Vadim

Great. This a really good news and can improve a lot the performance
of best GUI, IMHO, that I found for Maxima.

The version I have in Debian, see below, does not come with these
features. I installed by myself and I found it very useful but with
some little problems. I suggest that these Emacs modes be the default
ones in substituition to the old maxima-mode.  In this way we can
discuss, unite and improve these modes. 

Another suggestion is for Camm to add this ASAP to the Debian unstable
distribution.

Thanks for the replies; I'm using Slakware-8.0 and gcc-2.95.3.  I'll
try recompiling gcl and maxima before downgrading to an earlier
version of gcl.

It works on Maxima 5.6 latest csv + clisp-2000.03-06 (SuSE 7.1 linux).
I've noticed a problem under clisp.

(3) todd_coxeter fails.

(C1) symet(n):=create_list(if (j - i) = 1 then (p(i,j))^^3 else

I've given it a shot, and so far I agree that this is an excellent
feature to add to maxima.  I was unable to get the TeX part to work,
but I am more inclined to blame that on the slightly older version of
maxima I have at home.  From what I could see, however, this is
remarkable work.

I do have one question - does this work on Windows?  I know we are a
ways from another bundled maxima Windows binary, but it'd be nice if we
could have this ability for Windows emacs users, too.  (Not my
priority, obviously, but probably worth at least checking out.)

Also, does this work with emacs 21?  I'd be surprised if backward's
compatibility were broken, but with a major version number you wonder a
bit.

Agreed. In the TeX department, Barton is continuing to work on the
LaTeX stuff mentioned earlier, and his processor should be able to
generate LaTeX output visually similar to that of TeXmacs.  (The style
which IMHO would work best for the User Manual, although hopefully
we'll be able to do either ascii art or TeX.)  

Speaking of improving the emacs mode, does anyone else have trouble
with  mismatched parenthesis on some of the inputs when using maxima in
emacs?  In my case it seems to be a bit flacky.

Hi Vadim,

Thanks for the reply.  Which gcl-2.3.8 are you using?  There are
several beta versions in Schelter's FTP site, the last being only a
few days younger than the 2.4.0 one.

Is this the problem I mentioned to the list?  If so, do you have a
patch file?  I'm not a lisp programmer, and simply greping for
special-function-p or special-operator-p doesn't turn up anything.

I built and installed clisp-2.27, however the cryptic comments in
maxima's readme file aren't enough, the configure step still dies.

OK, it's pretty basic yet, but it's more or less ready and the new
website is up at http://maxima.sourceforge.net as the default. Take a
look and see what y'all think.  (Jay, the old temp page is at

There is one phrase up in top of the web-site (that I have seen around
quite a bit) that is somewhat misleading:

	Maxima is a descendant of DOE Macsyma, which had its origins in
the 	late 1960s at MIT. It is the oldest such system still in use
today ...

To be honest, Maxima is the ONLY such system still in use today, if we
are 
talking about Macsyma descendants. All others ones, Macsyma Inc, Aljabr,

Paramacs, Vaxima, ... are now defunct ... since the only one that
survived
is the open-source, I think we should remark that ... 

Seen from this light, one can try to gauge the importance of Bill's
work.
At times, at the end of the 80's beginning 90's there were some 7 or 8 
Versions of Macsyma around - pretty much all of them dead now, with the 
sole exception of Maxima.

I am running the latest maxima from the CVS under
clisp-2000.03.06-2mdk.i586.rpm
on a Mandrake 7.2 system and got TeXmacs to interface with maxima.
The contents of the file /usr/libexec/TeXmacs-0.3.5.5/bin/tm_maxima
had to be altered as follows:

#!/bin/sh
export MAXIMA_DIRECTORY=/usr/local/maxima-5.6.cl

clisp -q -M /usr/local/maxima-5.6.cl/src/maxima-clisp.mem -i \
/usr/share/TeXmacs-0.3.5.5/misc/maxima/texmacs.lisp | maxima_filter

This works for me.

Probably because it's really called special-form-p.  I think it's in

I think the new pages look very good. It's a great start. Definitely an

I would definitely like to see something on our web pages praising the
work Bill Schelter did to keep this version alive. At the same time I'd
like to see some mention of the fact that we are currently in a
transitional state.

OK, I've updated the front page to try to include the points mentioned
- if someone who is better at this would write up a good introduction I
would be more than happy to put that in instead - I'm not really all
that good at this kind of stuff.

I agree the cryptic comments are not enough. Here are some more cryptic
comments.

1) Forget configure
2) type "cd src"
3) type "make compile-clisp"
4) type "clisp -M maxima.mem"

Please understand that we know this is all a mess right now. Fixing
compiling and lisp implementation problems is the primary goal for the
6.0 release. Unfortunately, we aren't there yet.

Perhaps we could add a biography of Bill, to be written by one of
his friends at the University of Texas, and a photography?

That's an interesting point - I wonder how many people got left out in

That's probably a manual thing - I kind of had it in mind to work those
into the history section, which is probably the most relevant place for
them now. I think I also found some other Macsyma sources, but I would
be dubious of their legality until proven otherwise.  Actually, though,
that's a worthwhile question - do any of the other versions, if they
are still out there, have any features Maxima doesn't (becides the
Macsyma GUI stuff)?  I know there was one at one point which could run
on MacOS, but other than that I have no idea.

Thanks, from also (I'm sure) J�rgen Tischer and William Schelter.

What part of the TeX part didn't work?  If I get some details, perhaps
I can fix it.  I'm not sure a slightly older version of Maxima is at
fault.
To get the Maxima output in TeX form, I had emacs send the line
tex(%);
and then get the output.  This occasionally does some squirrelly
things when := is used.

(C1) tex(sin(x));

$$\sin x$$
(D1)                                 FALSE
(C2) tex(f(x):=sin(x));

|
f(x):=SIN(x);|
(D2)                                 FALSE

Of course, sending tex(%); and grabbing the output messes up the d#
references, as well as % and %%, which is why when the TeX output is
used, EMaxima doesn't put in the (D#), and TeX output currently isn't
an option for MaximaDoc.  Ideally, Maxima would have a switch that
would allow the output to be already in TeX form, much like there is
currently the option to use 1D or 2D output.  
Another option is to have the Maxima process evaluate a file that
causes it to display the output in TeX form, much like TeXmacs does.
It should be reasonably easy to alter the TeXmacs file to do this.

I don't know, I haven't tried it.
If no-one else tries it, I can install NTEmacs on my wife's computer
and test it out.

Or rather, does it work with emacs 20?  (I'm using emacs 21 myself.)
I don't think that I used any emacs 21 specific features, so it should
work on emacs 20, but I haven't tested it out.

Okay, I have it working with XEmacs, I think.
You'll need the newer maxima.el and maxima-font-lock-xemacs.el
at
ftp://vh213601.truman.edu/pub/Maxima
(With Emacs, the newer maxima.el needs the newer maxima-font-lock.el,
by the way.)

I needed to change the font-locking a bit, since XEmacs has fewer
font-lock-*-face's built in.  Rather than use fewer faces in Emacs, I
just made a new font-lock file for XEmacs.  I'll probably combine the
two in the near future, but this is a quick fix.
Also, font-locking acted a bit strange for me when I tried it, I need
to fix it a bit more, and it may be better for now to leave it off.

The other thing I needed to change was the process filter.  Emacs and
XEmacs handle processes (or rather the comint frontends handle
processes) a bit different.  So the quick fix was to use a simpler
filter for XEmacs.  The only difference will be in the debugging, the
Emacs version has dbl built into it, it won't work in XEmacs.
I seem to recall someone saying that the dbl debugging depends on GCL,
and since it isn't clear that GCL will remain the standard underlying
lisp, I probably won't worry about fixing this.  (Unless someone
really wants it...)

	I think the most important feature that the others ones had 
	that Maxima dies not, is the maintenance of the Macsyma code
	itself. Many customers of Macsyma, Inc and others like Aljbr,
	etc, fed corrections to them, that was supposed to be passed 
	back to the original source code and most of the time was never
	done.... I am a strong believer that the momentum of the open-
	source community can do better than all those years of
improvement
	on the closed code of Macsyma, Inc, Paramacs, Aljbr, etc ... and
	if any of them would like to help improve the code, they can
just
	offer it here - I head from Bill a year ago, that ALL of the

That's really great. I'm an XEmacs user myself. I'd really like to get
your (X)Emacs code in the cvs repository, probably as a subdirectory of
the maxima module. We are going to rearrange files for the 5.9 series,
so where we put it right now is not too important. Is it OK with you to
put your stuff in cvs? Do you have an account on sourceforge?

I'd really like to get debugging working under other lisps for the 6.0
release. I don't know yet if it will be possible.

Not. This is specific clisp-Maxima problem but its "discovery" was
inspired by your problem with gcl=Maxima. I've just tried this
expression
under clisp and run into the problem. And I'm sorry for
misspelling function name (thank Raymond for noticing this).
It is reads "special-form-p" and it must be replaced by ether
"ext:special-form-p" or better by "special-operator-p".
But once again its has nothing to do with gcl.

There is no configure stage for building Maxima under clisp.
You have to run
   make clisp-compile CLISP=clisp
   make maxima-clisp.mem CLISP=clisp
   make test-clisp CLISP=clisp
But before doing this replace calls of the functions
gc and saveinitmem in the file in the src/clisp-compile.
by ext:gc and ext:saveinitmem.

I don't know if Paul Wang from Kent State University is on this
list, but he wrote a few programs that may not have made it
into Schelter's code.  In particular some enhancements to
polynomial factorization (written in C).

As far as stuff done at Berkeley, I have a few pieces of
code written in C that could be interfaced to Maxima related
to FFT-based polynomial arithmetic, as well as interfaces
to the aribtrary-precision float MPFUN. These were not written
with GCL or CLISP in mind.  I also have a (lisp) package that
could be used to make the simplifier run, in some cases, many
times faster: this is based on hashtables to represent very
large sums.  While experiments show it can be even 100 times
faster, it is probably not ready for "prime time".

I also have integration look-up code, though it is not
really macsyma-oriented, rather it is a web server.  The
idea is: if you have a problem, look it up in our table.
(20 millisecs).  If you find it, go away happy.  If you don't
find it, run some algorithms.  

I would still like to figure some way of getting the
commercial macsyma improvements into maxima. 

In any of these efforts (my own included)  there is always
the danger of someone saying "I have a really good replacement
for the X module"  when in reality it is in almost all
ways inferior.  A valuable component of this group
effort would be thorough testing.  Presumably the
commercial people developed test suites.

I've used both, I'm using Emacs now because people I work with use
it.  There seem to be a few XEmacs users using Maxima, I'd better fix
the font-locking...

That's my fault, actually - mactex.lisp didn't get installed in 5.5,
for some reason.  I've got to fix my Maxima install.

I agree that would be good - how much work do you think that would be?

Well, in older versions it just gave me a parenthesis mismatched error
- this would only happen once in a while.  In the new emaxima, here's
what I'm getting occasionally:

error in process filter: Invalid regexp: "Unmatched ) or \\)" [2 times]

from this input:

\maxima
diff(2*cos(x),x);
\endmaxima

It does give me output, though. In a previous cell I did this (same
session) without trouble:

\maxima
integrate(sin(x),x);
\output
(D1) 				   - COS(x)
\endmaxima

I'd noticed that - one of the cooler websites I've seen lately :-)  Has
anyone tested maxima against that huge list of intergals?

Hear hear.  Unfortunately, that would mean finding it, and convincing
whoever has it to let go of it.  If I recall correctly, Richard Petti
can't disclose the buyer, and the buyer sure hasn't disclosed
him/herself, even by marketing the product or trying to sell it.  Also,
since that person probably paid a good chunck of cash for it, they are
also probably going to be reluctant to let go of it for free.

If not, maybe we could start with the make test stuff and develop our
own, adding each case anyone has trouble with in old or new code and
building up from there?

It's not quite THAT mysterious. I think the buyer was
Andrew Topping.  Why he let all the people go and stopped
selling it is not clear.

I don't know how much he paid for it.  What would you
pay for a company that loses money each month, and has
done so for years?  (I know that also characterizes
Amazon.com)

	Who is this guy ? Is there a chance he could be acting

I never got that, the the process filter is somewhat large, for
debugging.  Try using the latest maxima.el (which is where the process
filter is), which has a simpler filter (without the maxima debugging
stuff).  (The more complicated filter can be used by setting 
inferior-maxima-use-debug to t before the process is started.)
With the simpler filter, either the problem won't occur, or it'll be
easier to track down.
The latest version is in the Maxima cvs, in the directory emacs.

I've been playing a little with the texmacs file. Now that Emacs 21
supports images, it would neat to grab the TeX output, pass it off to
TeX and dvips and insert the image in the Maxima buffer.

I thought it would be rather hard to do line breaking of long equations,
but I found a LaTeX package which does that quite well -- the rest is
pretty straightforward.

Here's a screenshot of how it looks at the moment:

Holy cow.  Between this and Emaxima, we've got some seriously cool
stuff going on here.  We are so close to a notebook style interface
it's not even funny.  Guess I'll be upgrading to emacs 21.

How does this work for saving/printing?  Do you just use the graphical
images for display in emacs and use TeX/postscript for output?

One question.  I know the standard display for maxima is one expression
after the other, but would it be possible in this mode to it like
Mathematica does, i.e. being able to do something like :

(C1)  integrate(sin(x),x);
(D1)                        -COS(x)
(C2)  diff(x^2,x);
(D2)                   2x
   
and then be able to change the integral in place, so what you wind up
seeing on screen is

(C3)  integrate(cos(x),x);
(D3)                        SIN(x)
(C2)  diff(x^2,x);
(D2)                   2x

rather than having to do a strictly linear setup - i.e. being able to
have the result like the above as opposed to

(C1)  integrate(sin(x),x);
(D1)                        -COS(x)
(C2)  diff(x^2,x);
(D2)                   2x
(C3)  integrate(cos(x),x);
(D3)                        SIN(x)

Instead of presenting the user with the (C#) prompt, we could just wait
for them to type on the next line, and when they tell it to evaluate
then assume it is (C#), label it as such, and send it.  That way, we
would allow comments between lines, and only lines on which they use
the evaluate command sequence would be sent to Maxima.

Of course, as far as Maxima is concerned this wouldn't make any
difference, since everything is still in memory, but would be
convenient for notebook style editing.  I don't know how much trouble
this would be, or if anyone else would like this, but I thought I'd
ask.  You've already done some really amazing stuff - with the
abilities above we might be able to make an honest to goodness notbook
interface.  This would be sort of the intermediate step between the
terminal and using the emaxima/LaTeX, with immediate formatted
feedback.  Would that be possible?

I got the font-locking to work better for XEmacs (at least it works
better here), and made the fonts customizable.
The same file also works for Emacs and XEmacs, so I got rid of
maxima-font-lock-xemacs.el.  I had to change most of the elisp files,
so if anyone tries it out, they'll need all the latest elisp files. 
(ftp://vh213601.truman.edu/pub/Maxima).
It works for me on Emacs 21 and XEmacs, but I haven't tried it on
Emacs 20.  (The face specifications may have been changed between 20
and 21, but it'd be easy enough to fix if there's a problem.)  
If it works for Emacs 20 (can someone try it out?), I'd like to check
it into the Maxima cvs.  Would that be okay?

I did a few tests with XEmacs 21.1.14 and Emacs 20.7. I couldn't find
anything wrong. However, this is the first time in a long time I've
looked at the maxima-(x)emacs interface, so I'm sure I didn't do a
thorough test. Basically, I ran maxima with syntax highlighting turned
on. I also evaluated a cell in an Emaxima document and verified that I
could latex the result.

I would love to come up with a test suite for your package but since it
is primarily an interactive interface, I don't really know what we could
do.

> Would that be okay?

That would be more than okay. It's very good work. Please commit your
changes.

I tried this with Matlab:

iz =

     1     0
     0    -1

>> exp(i^iz)

ans =

                          1

  Column 2

                          1
           0.54030230586814 -     0.841470984807897i


...so i got the same result what Maxima returns. Looks like
Maxima is correct unless also Matlab has the same bug.

Generally, maxima functions map or "thread" over lists or
matrices.  For example, let f be the function that squares.
(C1) display2d : false;
(D1) FALSE
(C2) f(x) := x^2;
(D2) f(x):=x^2

/* Apply f to the list [1,2,3] */

(C3) f([1,2,3]);


/* The result is [1^2, 2^2, 3^3]; we say f maps over the list.*/

(D3) [1,4,9]


/* The same holds for matrices. */

(C4) m : matrix([a,b],[c,d]);
(D4) MATRIX([a,b],[C,D])
(C5) f(m);
(D5) MATRIX([a^2,b^2],[C^2,D^2])

/* Notice that the result is *not* m^2.  To evaluate m^2, use the
dot operator. */

(C6) m.m;
(D6) MATRIX([b*C+a^2,b*D+a*b],[C*D+a*C,D^2+b*C])

/* All this applies to the exponential function as well */

(C8) exp(m);
(D8) MATRIX([%E^a,%E^b],[%E^C,%E^D])

/* The function exp is mapped over the elements of the matrix
m; this isn't *the* matrix exponential. */


To find *the* matrix exponential exp(m) = id + m + m^2/2! + m^3/3! + ...,
you need the spectral representation of m; thus you need the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of m.  Maxima doesn't have a single
command for *the* matrix exponential (that I can find).  Using
Maxima's eigenvectors function, you could write your own.  If your
matrices are selfadjoint, the algorithm is fairly straightforward;
otherwise, see an advanced linear algebra book.

Hope this helps,

Barton Willis

P.S.  On the sourceforge maxima page, change "thanks to it's open" to
"thanks to its open".

If you want to compute numerical matrix exponentials then you
should probably find a numerical package.
If you want to compute SYMBOLIC matrix exponentials, you can
compute the taylor series of the matrix m,  e.g.
1+m+...+m^^n/n! + ...   where  a^^b  is macsyma's way of
computing a power of a matrix.


There may be a numerical matrix exponential routine written
in macsyma/lisp,  but exp(M) doesn't compute it.

I can't seem to use M-x maxima to launch a regular maxima session.  Is
there some trick to that with this new mode?  Something I need to put
in my .emacs file?

Cancel that last question - I'm an idiot.  In case anyone else makes
the same mistake, here's more or less what you want in your .emacs
file:

(require 'font-latex)
(require 'tex-site)
(autoload 'emaxima-mode "emaxima" "EMaxima" t)
(add-hook 'emaxima-mode-hook 'emaxima-mark-file-as-emaxima)

(autoload 'maxima-mode "maxima" "Maxima mode" t)
(autoload 'maxima "maxima" "Maxima interaction" t)
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.max" . maxima-mode) auto-mode-alist))

This allows both emaxima-mode and maxima-mode.

I don't think it simplifies to that:

(C1) cos(a+b+c)+cos(a+b-c);
(D1)                    COS(c + b + a) + COS(c - b - a)
(C2) trigexpand(d1);
(D2)            2 COS(a) COS(b) COS(c) - 2 SIN(a) SIN(b) COS(c)

Seems like factorization is in order 

(C3) factor(d2);

(D3)             - 2 (SIN(a) SIN(b) - COS(a) COS(b)) COS(c)

and a trigreduce should combine the stuff in the parens

(C4) trigreduce(d3);

(D4)                          2 COS(b + a) COS(c)

maybe this is what you wanted?

Subject: [Maxima] clisp Maxima patches
Message-ID: <3BF13CAA.6ADB2326@mail.ru>

I'm going to upload to Maxima CVS at SourceFourge
a little patch which is aimed to resolve Maxima problems
with different clisp version.

It seems that now at least two clisp versions are
commonly used. Old one dated 06.03.2000 and
new clisp 2.27 (July 2001). Presently Maxima
works fine with old clisp but fails in several
places with new clisp 2.27. The point is that
in clisp 2.27 several functions utilized by Maxima
are moved into the new package EXT.
Now Maxima should work fine on both
versions of clisp.

Second patch is the courtesy of Raymond Toy and
it enables online info documentation browsing
under clisp. To enable this feature you have
to rebuild clisp with the REGEXP module.
Notice that even after this the REGEXP package
will be available if and only if you invoke
clisp with the option -K full
   clisp -K full
If yoy have it then rebuild Maxima with the option
  CLISP="clisp -K full"
and describe will work for you.

Best wishes,

Vadim

I wrote a simple-minded matrix exponential function.  My file
mat_exp.mc is attached; here is a demonstration:

(C5) m : matrix([2,1],[1,5])$

/*  matrix_function(sq,m) squares the matrix m;  we've got a

(C6) radcan(matrix_function(sq,m));

/* This checks.  Let's compute the cube of m and check.
*/

(C8) radcan(matrix_function(cube,m));
(D8) MATRIX([17,40],[40,137])
(C9) m^^3;
(D9) MATRIX([17,40],[40,137])

/* This also checks.  The matrix needn't be real; let's try
*/

(C10) m : matrix([%i,0],[0,-%i]);
(D10) MATRIX([%I,0],[0,-%I])

/* matrix_exp(m) = id + m + m^2/2! + m^3 / 3! + .... is the matrix
exponential.  Since m is diagonal, we should get
matrix([exp(%i),0],[0,exp(-%i)]).
*/
(C11) matrix_exp(m);
(D11) MATRIX([%E^%I,0],[0,%E^-%I])


/* This is okay. We do require that m be diagonable.  If it isn't,
matrix_function returns FALSE.
*/

(C12) m : matrix([1,1],[0,1]);
(D12) MATRIX([1,1],[0,1])
(C13) matrix_function(sq,m);
(D13) FALSE


/* To verify that m isn't diagonable, evaluate NONDIAGONALIZABLE;
*/

(C14) NONDIAGONALIZABLE;
(D14) TRUE


Before you trust this code for something that matters, give it
a good test; I've only tested it on a few problems.  If your
matrices are large (3 by 3 might be "large") or if they
have many symbolic elements, you'll run into trouble.

Maybe this helps.

It'd be easy enough to check to see if the output ends in a question
mark, in which case the output could be a minibuffer prompt, or the
maxima window could be popped up.
Are there any other cases when the output could have a question mark
in it?

It doesn't work. As far as I know, you can't print or save a buffer with
images ... at least not easily.

To print would require that ps-print.el is aware of images (which it
isn't at the moment), and to save you'd have to invent your own file
format -- maybe that's not so hard after all.

No, it doesn't work like that. The mode is basically just eye-candy for
the usual command line interface, i.e. instead of seeing the output as
ASCII graphics, you get a picture.

Let me explain a bit about how it works. When you make a
process-in-a-buffer mode, Emacs lets you specify a
preoutput-filter-function.  This filter receives all output from the
process, which it can manipulate and pass on to the function that
actually inserts it in the buffer.

So I made a filter which scans the output from Maxima for LaTeX
expressions, converts them to images and attaches an image property to
the expressions.  As far as Emacs is concerned all of it is still text
(some of it just happens to have an image property) and all the other
shell-like commands work as usual.

What you *can* do today is move point to (C1), edit the expression and
press enter, but the output will appear at the bottom like above.

I don't know how difficult this would be, but it sounds somewhat similar
to what "Emacs Lisp interaction mode" does.

BTW, have you tried bookmode.el in the Maxima distribution? It also
works a bit like that.


I have now cleaned up the image code a bit, and put it at:

  <http://purl.org/harder/imaxima.tar.gz>

Here's the commentary from the file:  

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file (and imaxima.lisp) provides image support for interacting
;; with the computer algebra system Maxima.
;;
;; The command `imaxima' provides a simple comint derived CLI mode.
;;
;; The function `imaxima-setup' is intended to be used with the modes
;; in maxima.el.  Maxima.el doesn't provide an exit-hook, so you'll
;; have to run `imaxima-clean-up' manually to clean up temporary files
;; and stop the running gs process.
;;
;; To turn off images, evaluate "display2d:true" in Maxima.  To turn
;; them on again, evaluate "display2d:imaxima".
;;
;; The package requires Emacs 21 with image support (the ms-windows
;; port doesn't support images yet).
;;
;; It may or may not work with recent versions of XEmacs -- my version
;; of XEmacs (21.1) doesn't provide `comint-preoutput-filter', so I
;; couldn't test it.
;;
;; A fairly recent version of Ghostscript is recommended (at least
;; newer than v. 5.5).  If your version is too old, you can either set
;; `imaxima-image-type' to 'ps or remove the options
;; "-dTextAlphaBits=4" and "-dGraphicsAlphaBits=4" from
;; `imaxima-gs-options'.  The images won't look nearly as attractive,
;; though -- the text looks ragged because it isn't anti aliased.
;;
;; The file "imaxima.lisp" is a slightly modified version of
;; "texmacs.lisp" in the TeXmacs distribution.  Several of the image
;; routines are borrowed from David Kastrup's preview-latex.el.
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;; 
;; * Copy imaxima.el and imaxima.lisp to somewhere in Emacs' load path,
;;   and byte-compile imaxima.el
;;
;; * Get the LaTeX package `breqn' from <ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/>.
;;   Install the package where TeX can find it -- e.g. install in your
;;   texmf or local.texmf tree and run texhash.
;;
;; * To use with maxima.el, put
;;
;;   (add-hook 'inferior-maxima-mode-hook 'imaxima-setup t)
;;
;;   in .emacs.

;;
;; Bugs/TODO:
;;
;; * Special LaTeX characters aren't always quoted by Maxima.
;;   print("}") shows the problem. example(syntax) provides more
;;   examples.  `imaxima-quote' tries to make it a little more robust,
;;   but as a result characters inside \verb are incorrectly quoted.
;;
;; * It would be nice to put something more useful in the strings
;;   behind the images. Maybe something like string(%) would be a good
;;   idea.  It would make a "copy-last-output" command really useful.
;;   It has to be done in imaxima.lisp, but how?
;;
;; * Printing and saving the buffer doesn't use the images. This is
;;   mainly a missing feature in Emacs.
;;
;; * According to Jonathan Fine's paper in the EuroTeX 2001
;;   proceedings <http://www.ntg.nl/eurotex/Fine.pdf>, feeding input
;;   to a TeX daemon is 20 times as fast as starting a new TeX every
;;   time. Interesting, but maybe not worth the effort.

I was thinking that you could store the whole thing as a tex
internally, and then just save and print that.  Probably not worth it,
though - emaxima will handle that job.

No I haven't, actually.  Guess I'll check that out.

I tried to install, but it just gives me "Symbol's function definition
is void: imaxima-setup".  What would be causing that?

What would be easier in this case would be to have emacs prompt for the
answer when Maxima asks a question.
I made the fix so that this would happen, you need
maxima.el
in ftp://vh213601.truman.edu
It assumes that if Maxima gives some output that doesn't have a new
input prompt but does have a question mark, then it is asking a
question.  I suspect this may be right, but would like confirmation. 
I also added inferior-maxima-exit-hook,
which gets called when the maxima process buffer is killed.

Finally, maxima-font-lock.el has been slightly changed so that it
handles numbers better.  (1 and 12 will be fontified as constants,
the 1 in z1 won't be.)

Message-ID: <4neln1e0il.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

It's great that maxima is now on sourceforge so that the various
patches can get added.

However, what are the goals of maxima-pre59?  I know that a better
build process is one major goal.  What are the other goals?

I, of course, would like to see some of the more accurate numerical
routines get added, :-).  The things that I did a while ago had some
simple dependencies on f2cl.  Should those be removed before being
integrated?  It would be much easier if we just added the f2cl
macros/functions that we need so that we can just take the converted
code without hand modifications.

For updates and things, should we send patches here for possible
inclusion in to the sources?  Or is there some other way?

Thanks,

Ray

I hadn't thought about that. Right now it's stored internally as e.g.

(C1) expand((a+b+c)^5);

(D1)  c^{5}+5\*b\*c^{4}+5\*a\*c^{4}+10\*b^{2}\*c^{3}+20\*a\*b\*c^{3}+
 10\*a^{2}\*c^{3}+10\*b^{3}\*c^{2}+30\*a\*b^{2}\*c^{2}+30\*a^{2}\*b\*
 c^{2}+10\*a^{3}\*c^{2}+5\*b^{4}\*c+20\*a\*b^{3}\*c+30\*a^{2}\*b^{2}
 \*c+20\*a^{3}\*b\*c+5\*a^{4}\*c+b^{5}+5\*a\*b^{4}+10\*a^{2}\*b^{3}+
 10\*a^{3}\*b^{2}+5\*a^{4}\*b+a^{5}

(C2) 'integrate(sinh(x)*x^3,x);

(D2)  \int {x^{3}\*\sinh x}{\;dx}

(C3) quit();

It wouldn't be hard to transform it to a LaTeX document.

You probably need

    (require 'imaxima)

before you reference imaxima-setup in your .emacs.

This is neat!

(The TeX output is a bit small in my Emacs buffer, though, (or rather,
I use too large of a font size!).  With the extsizes package, more
imaxima-pt-size's are possible.  I added the line
"\\usepackage{extsizes}\n" to imaxima-tex-to-ps so I can use a 20 pt
font.)

Jim's original proposal had this outline:

Incorporate new build system when I am done with it. Clean up
package. Call the new version Maxima 5.9. The purpose of this release 
is to act as a beta release for the first major release of the new
Maxima project, 6.0.  Focus for 5.9 should be the shift to parity among
ANSI Common Lisp implementations.

If i read this correctly, what he is saying (and I think it's a sound
idea) is to focus on three thing right now - the new build system,
trying to organize and clean up the structure and packages, and
compiling on different Lisps.  I'm not sure where the numerical code
falls in that, but at a guess that's probably a 6.1 feature.

Suggestions I would have for 5.9:

Incorporate all the (good) fixes that have been sent in to the list
over the past year or so which haven't already been included.

Go through all the packages contained in places like share, share1,
share2, etc. and figure out what they all do and why they are there. 
Also, which ones should be included, with an expectation that they be
usable, and which need to be pulled until more extensive work is done. 
Also, if possible, duplication should be minimized to avoid confusion
(the two vector packages is a good example - if I recall correctly each
has bugs/features the other lacks, and it would make more sense to
either combine them or if there is a definite reason for having two
make it clear why there are two and what each does.)

Try to recreate the process by which the original maxima-5.5 binary for
Windows was created, or come up with another process that works, and be
able to release a 5.9 version for Windows.

Sounds good.  I guess what goes in depends on when 5.9/6.0 is
released.  It gets hard to keep things in sync if changes are kept out
for a long time.  Perhaps a branch for 5.9/6.0 and a development
branch that includes other stuff?  

I'll leave these and other questions to the official maintainers. :-)

Good luck figuring this all out!  (I'm opposed to pulling things out.
There's no harm in leaving them there.)

Message-ID: <4n1yj1dqut.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

I've just started using the new maxima and maxima-mode stuff on
XEmacs.  This is good stuff.

However, I have one complaint.  I use C-M-b, which is normally bound
to backward-sexp, all the time to move backwards to the first paren.
It's quite annoying to me that maxima-mode rebinds this to send the
function to the maxima process.  Same complaint for C-M-f.

Any chance in changing this?  I could do it myself, but I don't like
to change the keybindings of other peoples packages.

Some of the keybindings are left over from a previous package, where I
was running out of keystrokes to use.
Anyhow, I'd certainly be willing to change keybindings, if there are
no complaints.
Any complaints?  Any suggestions?

First of all, it's
ftp://vh213601.truman.edu/pub/Maxima

Next, I found a problem when a cell with questions is TeX updated.
I fixed that, and if an answer doesn't end with a ; or $, a ; is
automatically added.
The changed files are maxima.el and emaxima.el.

Well, that was certainly part of the problem - now when I do M-x maxima
I get:

Hi all,

I am trying to use the two tensor packages that come with Maxima 5.6.
The manual says one has to load the modules by entering

LOADFILE("itensr");

or

LOADFILE("ctensr");

This gives me an error in both cases: ``Load failed for ~m''.
Reading the special doc files that come with the tensor packages
tells me to try e.g.

LOADFILE(itensr,fasl,tensor);

or alternatively

TSETUP();

Unfortunately, these methods to load the packages fail too. Did
I miss installing some files? Do I have to download from somewhere
the latest tensor packages? How does anybody of you work with
tensors under Maxima?

Thanks a lot for any suggestions.
Best,
      Mike

Helo,
By default, only "ctensr.mac" is copied to the installation directory. It can be loaded by
load("ctensr.mac"). This package is quite possible to use. At least I was able to reproduce all
examples in tensor.doc with it. However I would not say the same about itensor.lisp. It is left
 in source dir after "make install" because it was not tested enough. To use it you can put
 all files from tensor source dir in place where you want  and
start maxima there. After this all commands to load packages will work.
It's pity but not all examples from tensor.doc are successfull for itensor.lisp. I guess it is due to the different versions of lisps between macsyma an maxima. I'm not sure about it
my knowledge of lisp is poor. 

all the best, Valerij

As a long-time user of XEmacs and the ilisp package (a great package
BTW), I am partial to the keybindings there.  (I wonder if ilisp with
some modifications could support maxima-mode?)

I haven't come across the first problem, but I did come across the
LaTeX error.  In my case, it was because I didn't have all the files
from breqn installed.  (It takes more than just breqn.sty.)  
Also, there are log files in the temporary directory that you can look
at; they might help.

I think I've found a better way than ^C to load the file without
incrementing the labels. Hopefully this should make the problem go away.

I have now made "LaTeX error in" clickable -- mouse-2 shows the error
log and mouse-3 the LaTeX source, so it should be easier to find the
error. My guess is that TeX can't find the breqn package.

I'm not that familiar with ilisp, but I went through the manual
looking at the keybindings.  My thoughts are at the end of this
message.

I'm not sure what this means.  ilisp is for common lisp, and
apparently it takes some doing to get it going for lisp dialects like
scheme.  

Jay

I'm not really familiar with ilisp, so some of my comparisons may be
off.  But here's what I have.  Ideas?


Motion commands     Keybinding   Notes

End of form         C-cC-e       This is bound to eval-defun in ilisp,
                                 which corresponds to send-form.  Use
                                 C-cC-e for send-form, and change this
                                 to M-e?

Beginning of form   C-cC-a       This is unbound in ilisp, but could

I've tried to compile with Clisp, but here's what I get:

Somewhere in the sources, I think maxima calls lisp:gc.  In later
versions of Clisp, it should be ext:gc.

I think.

About the keybindings I have a suggestion: try to keep as close as
possible to the keybindings of the AucTex package to edit TeX/LaTeX
files.

As ilisp does not seem  to be a unanimity among Lisp programmers (am I
right??), I feel that TeX/LaTeX is more common. BTW maybe most of the
users of Maxima are not Lisp programmers (my case!) but need to keep
documentation of their work up-to-date. 

In this sense I will try to give my two cents on this question. Maybe
someone else can correct or improve my suggestion.

I dont like C-c( and C-c) for ergonomic reasons in my keyboard. Anyway
M-C- is not good either, but I still prefer this option. The same
discussion can be done about most of the keybindings.

Good extra keybindings.

Most interfaces, like Gnome, use M-TAB to change windows. This problem
can be overcome, but some novice users of Emacs and/or Maxima may
complain about it.

Keep ilisp keybinding C-c; which is the same as AucTex.

To uncomment a region maybe C-c: for the same reason and then the next
two keybindings must be appropriately changed.

Good for me. But again some problems can found, with the F12 key, in
some weird keyboards throughout the world.


The other keybindings I did not mention here I agree or I have no
suggestions at all.

This is exactly one of the problems I intend to fix. In several
places function calls (gc) must be replaced by (ext:gc).
Or the better way - make (use-package "EXT") during Maxima
build process. Unfortunately I have some troubles with
SourceForge so the patches are not there yet.

Just wishful thinking on my part so I don't have to learn yet another
keybinding. :-) Ilisp basically talks to some lisp process which is
not unlike what we are trying to do with maxima.  But if it's very
tightly coupled with Lisp, then it's probably too much work to get
ilisp to work with maxima.

I've only started using maxima-mode, so I don't have a lot of
experience with it yet.  Of course, the closer it is to ilisp, the
happier I would be, but that's up to you.

Note that ilisp's prefix character is configurable.  I think the
default is C-z.

M-e means forward-sentence in XEmacs.  I never use this.

M-a is backward-sentence.  Ilisp uses M-C-a to move to the beginning
of a defun.  M-C-e moves to the end of a defun.  Is that what form
means here?

I find M-C-b easier to type, and M-C-b works this way in C/C++ mode, not
just Lisp mode.

You mean C-c b?  C-c C-b is an undocumented ilisp-compile-buffer.
This is probably pretty close to send buffer.

Or send buffer would be analogous to selecting a region and doing send
region and therefore not needed, except as a convenience?

I think you mean C-c l.  Couldn't this load up a maxima .mc or .lisp
file into the running maxima?

On XEmacs C-RET is bound to 'complete to complete the previous

What kind of cleanup would you need to do?  When I use ilisp, I just
kill the lisp buffer.  Ilisp has C-c z to repair the connection
(hopefully) in case things get messed up

I think C-c; is also used in other modes to comment a region.

    Jay>                                      the long comment.  Change to C-c*?

In C/C++ mode, this is M-;.  Lisp modes use this to put a ";" to the
right side of a line.

I almost always have this automatic so that when I press a space,

Message-ID: <15349.8859.223911.972750@maths.qmul.ac.uk>

As far as I see, when using imaxima, the package breqn.sty
formats the first "(" in the "D" label as a normal-font
bracket and the last one in \texttt, which is the desired style.
The fix is to change lin 193 of breqn.sty to

d\eqnumform#1{\texttt{(}#1\@@italiccorr\texttt{)}} % Add parens

I think this is interesting to get a good output if you are using
larger fonts (in fact, if you use small ones, the problem exists,
but it is more difficult to see).

Hope it helps,


     Pedro.

Given the progress Jay has made with EMaxima, the following may
be of little interest.  Nevertheless:

I modified Maxima's continue function so that it outputs TeX and
wrote a batchlatex function that looks for Maxima commands that
are embedded in LaTeX.  My lisp code and some documentation may
be downloaded from

http://www.unk.edu/acad/math/people/willisb/home.html

This page has some additional Maxima code.

So do you suggest simply replacing the current maxima mode .el files
with these new versions, or making a separate emaxima package, having
these and the emaxima stuff?

Take care,

I have found this approach quite interesting. Thank you for posting it
here

After reading the documentation I have not been able to install
the whole stuff properly.

Firstly, I put the battex.sty in my texmf tree, then 
I run texhash. Secondly I copied the batchtex.lisp to 
/usr/local/lib/maxima-5.6/share/batchtex.lisp and then I
created the file ex1.tex (the same Barton proposed
as example in the documentation)

and located at ~/tmp there exists a file ex1.tex.

I am missing something important?
Please could you point me out what I have misunderstood?

Thank you very much for your help

Message-ID: <4npu6ia7m1.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

I've appended a patch for a small bug in mdebug.lisp that could affect
describe for cmulisp.  When you ask for help:

(C1) ? integrate;

cmucl actually tries to look up "ntegrate".  The leading i is dropped.

This is actually caused by a bug.  The does an unread-char after it
has already done a peek-char.  The CLHS says this behavior is
undefined.  On Clisp, this is ok, but cmucl drops a character.  The
following patch fixes this so that cmucl will look for "integrate"
instead.

I have an update for this that should work much faster.  It requires a
change to macdes.lisp.  I'm attaching a patch for that and I'm
attaching a new version of cl-info.lisp.

There's one major change:  If there's only one possible match, cl-info
doesn't ask you which one you want to see.  It displays it without
prompting anymore.

However, this new cl-info.lisp won't work for cmucl.  I'm also
attaching a new version of cmulisp-regex.lisp so cl-info will work for
cmulisp too.

I hope this is useful to someone.

To use batchlatex, you need to load batchtex.lisp:

(C1) load("batchtex.lisp");
Loading batchtex.lisp
Finished loading batchtex.lisp
(D1)                batchtex.lisp

Place batchtex.lisp in a directory Maxima can find; Maxima's
share directory should work.  I added a sentence about
loading batchtex.lisp to my documentation.

I haven't installed emaxima-mode yet (I am waiting for a .deb file :)
but I think that both modes can coexist. You decide which mode to use
in the personal .emacs

instead of 
(require 'maxima-mode)

you put something like 

(require 'emaxima-mode)

Am I right, Jay?

Anyway, if creating an extra package like emaxima is not a huge work,
maybe this would be a good option, mainly in this bug tracking period.

Almost. emaxima depends on maxima.el, which provides the ability to
run Maxima as an inferior process, and maxima-mode, which aids in
formatting Maxima code, etc. 
EMaxima uses maxima.el to interact with a Maxima process, so EMaxima
has 
(require 'maxima)
in it.
So they can both coexist, and they are used for different things.

Does this require your new version of mactex as well?  I've tried
running it and I get:

(C4) batchlatex("maximaexample.tex");

Or do I need the CVS version of maxima?

First, my documentation had a missing semicolon at the end of
expand(f(a,b)).
The correct file is

-------start ex1.mc--------------------
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{battex}
\begin{document}
\noident We begin by defining the function that squares.  We do this with
the Maxima commands
\begin{maxima}
     f(x) := x^2;
     f(a);
     expand(f(a+b));
\end{maxima}
\end{document}
-------end ex1.mc--------------------

Second, because of the difference between end of lines in UNIX and
Windows, my code may misbehave under Windows.  I have used it
successfully with NT; I just have my editor save as a UNIX file.

Let me know if it doesn't fix the problem.

I have the pre59 module in mind as a place to put code, documentation,
etc., while we prepare to rearrange the module for release as 5.9.
Little bug fixes are definitely appropriate.

Right. We might consider them a bug fix. I'm really not sure. I have to
confess that at the time you were discussing your more accurate
numerical routines I wasn't paying as much attention as I am now. I
think we should re-open the topic for discussion. I should also point
out that I think Richard has the final say on whether the new routines
go in.

I don't know. I'd have to take a look at the code you have and the f2cl
routines.

If the patches are small, please send them to the list. If they are not
small, say so and we will work something out.

This business of functions moving packages is a pain. (Grumble,

OK. Could you explain why we need to use the "full" linking set? I am
not arguing, but I would like to understand the issue.

We should put something about the plan on the web page. I will try to

5.9 is supposed to be the development series for 6.0. I would like 6.0
to be released as soon as possible, but no sooner. I/we haven't been
doing this long enough for me to be comfortable trying to estimate
dates. Sorry.

I was playing around with my elliptic function package and noticed
that the values my code computed differed a bit from the analytical
expressions involving the gamma function. 

A peek at the gamma routine showed that most of the constants were
given to only 5-6 digits.  So I replaced it with a more accurate
version and got the expected agreement.  That routine was sent to this
list.

Barton Willis pointed out that the the Bessel functions also didn't
seem very accurate, according to the tables in A&S.  I just replaced
these with routines converted from Fortran.

I don't think there's any downside since I'm not changing anything
other than the implementation of the numerical part of the functions.

I didn't send these to the list, so if you want to look at them, I can
send them here or to you directly, as you wish.  The Fortran routines
are pretty clean so the Lisp is too.

Ok.

By default, clisp uses some base set of packages.  The -K full gives
the full linking set that contains the REGEX package that cl-info
needs.  Without the full set, the REGEX package isn't included.  This
also means that cl-info won't work on any clisp system that doesn't
have a working foreign function interface.

Perhaps I should look into using some Lisp regex package?  Then
everyone wins.

Yes, but perhaps not the problem you might think.
As long as Maxima's response contains a new input prompt, EMaxima
doesn't check for a question mark.
However, input is sent to Maxima one form at a time, so it can get
each output as it comes out.  When sending forms, EMaxima looks for
;'s and $'s.
Adding a check to look for a :lisp, and then sending the :lisp and the
following sexp shouldn't be too hard, and should take care of the
problem the evil input above would cause.  I'll do that when I get a
chance.

I found a way to fix it without patching breqn.sty. I also made the
parens the same colour as the label.

The new version should also feel faster -- especially for big expression
(try comparing something like zeromatrix(20,20);).

Here's the ChangeLog for the new version
<http://purl.org/harder/imaxima.tar.gz>:

;;      * Use `view-file-other-window' instead of `view-file' for
;;        LaTeX errors.
;;
;;      * Make equation color customizeable, `imaxima-equation-color'.
;;
;;      * Add more color names, `imaxima-color-list'.
;;
;;      * Fix look of parens in labels.
;;
;;      * `imaxima-fnt-size', make LaTeX text size customizeable:
;;        normalsize, large, Large etc.
;;        From: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso <P.Fortuny at maths.qmw.ac.uk>

;;        Maxima buffer.

Message-ID: <8D00C32549556B4E977F81DBC24E985D41007B@crtsmail1.technol_exch.corp.riotinto.org>

I have just built and tested the sourceforge cvs maxima on a PC using cygwin
and clisp-2.27.  

clisp was built using the recipe I posted on 6 Nov.  (I have not succeeded
in building maxima using the win32 binary of clisp, or in building gcl).

The cvs code built out of the box:
cd src
make clisp-compile
make maxima-clisp.mem
make test-clisp

Test results are OK.  The only problem I have is that the quit() command
doesn't work.  The following hack works for me.  It needs to have the
conditional compilation stuff put back - I couldn't do it.

The vector A is result from transformation matrices, but I need  the the
solution in a simpler expression, i.e. B. I want to reduce from A to B.
When I apply a command sequence like:
trigreduce(factorout(ratexpand(trigexpand(A[2][1]),sin,cos));
it works  and
ratsimp(trigreduce(A[1][1]));
it also works,
but I need to apply the one sequence to the complete vector, something
like
trigreduce(factorout(ratexpand(trigexpand(A),sin,cos));
or
ratsimp(trigreduce(A));
it does not work... :(
Is it possible or I must apply different command sequences to every term
on the vector A?

Hi - Try using the "map" command (I did this recently for a similar
problem). You would do something like: map(ratsimp,A) where A is your
matrix.  Hope this helps.

Hi,

Please allow me to apologize in advance: I'm not going to solve your
problem, but I am going to ask a favor.

Please submit this bug report to the bug reporting system on the Maxima
project page, <http://sourceforge.net/projects/maxima>. I would like to
make sure that reported bugs are fixed before we release 6.0. It will be
much easier to keep track of such things if they are in the bug
reporting system.

I would like to encourage everyone else to use the bug reporting system,
also.

Thanks,
Jim

I have the same problem. It is quite common when we try to multiply
homogeneneous matrices. I sincerely tried several combinations of
trigreduce, trigsimplify, ratexpand, etc...

I cannot catch the ppoint with trigonometrical functions at all.




    Dan> Have you tried

            [ r SIN(tB) COS(tD + 2 tC) - dA SIN(tB) SIN(tD + tC) ]


This is the point : This result is not good enough as 

matrix([cos(tB)*sin(tD + tC)],
       [r*sin(tB)*cos(tD+2*tC) - dA*sin(tB)*sin(tD+tC)]);

is the desired solution. For this simple matrix this can be a matter
of taste but when we multiply in cascade a series of homogeneneous
matrices we cannot control the results in a short time.

Where is my (our?) fault

However, that does not fully simplify the second term.  You have to do more work.  One
way
of doing this is to create a matching rule, that looks at expressions and see if they
contain a sum
of tD + tC + tB, and then try to use trigreduce(factor(trigexpand(e))) instead.

I don't know that for sure; I seem to recall reading that it was
non-trivial to get it working with scheme, even.  (I had tried to
install it before, but it didn't work with Emacs 21 at the time.
Perhaps I should try it again.)

A lot of the ilisp keybindings seem to match the keybindings in the
programming modes that come with Emacs, which is something that should
be taken care of.

Yes, I was looking at the fsf-compliant keybindings.  
(I think that's why some of our takes on the ilisp keybindings differ.)

Probably close enough.  Perhaps it should be M-C-a and M-C-e, then.

Yes, so it should be changed.

Okay, then, perhaps it should be C-c C-b

It's equivalent to selecting the whole buffer as the region and
sending the region.  Nothing wrong with an extra convenience...

Yes, it could.  I can easily add that, perhaps have maxima prompt for
a file name, and then call load?
Then send line could be C-c C-c?

So, perhaps keep C-RET, then?

I'll add a kill-buffer hook that will delete the process, and keep the
kill maxima command.
How do things get messed up?

These both do that, somewhat differently, so perhaps they're okay.

Here, Emacs would prompt you for a short comment, perhaps that should
be removed...
Anyhow, this can be changed to M-;

Actually, I think it's indistinguishable from C-TAB even on a
windowing system; at least it is for me.  C-cC-m is indistinguishable
from C-cRET, I just wrote them C-cC-letter for mnemonic reasons.

That could be done, but then if someone defines a function which is
the prefix of a built-in function, it could get annoying.

Actually, in Emacs lisp mode, C-M-h is mark defun.  Perhaps that
should be used here.

The modes for writing documents, EMaxima and MaximaDoc, use the AucTeX
keybindings, with a few additions to deal with cells.
For Maxima mode, there are very few commands which are analogous to
TeX commands.
The ones that might be comparable (that I can come up with off-hand)
are
Command                      Keybinding
-------                      ----------
Complete symbol              ESC-TAB
Kill job                     C-cC-k
Command buffer               C-cC-b
Command region               C-cC-r
Comment region               C-c;

These match the ilisp/lisp bindings, which is another reason why the
maxima bindings should be fixed (similar commands in different modes
should have the same keybindings).

Oh, good point.
But using M-TAB for completion is a standard thing in Emacs modes
(lisp, AucTeX,...), so I'm not sure this should change.  Still, it is
a bit of a problem.

Okay, that can be fixed.

>>>Completion help             f12         This is somewhat analogous to

Okay, perhaps Completion help could be bound to f12 and C-cC-h
and apropos help could be bound to M-f12 and C-cC-a?

So, what about the following keybindings?

Motion commands     Keybinding
---------------     ----------
End of form         M-C-e
Beginning of form   M-C-a
Beginning of sexp   M-C-b

Send form            C-cC-e
Send line, as well   C-RET
as any nearby lines       
needed to complete
form.  Go to next
form.
Send region, as well M-RET
as any nearby lines       
needed to complete        
form.  Go to next         
form.
Kill Maxima.         C-cC-k

Completion commands     Keybinding
-------------------     ----------
complete symbol         M-TAB     
(present a buffer
with completions)
dynamic complete        C-TAB
(cycle through               
completions)                 

Commenting commands     Keybinding
-------------------     ----------
comment region          C-cC-;
uncomment region        C-cC-: 
insert long comment     M-C-;
insert short comment    M-;

Indentation commands     Keybinding
--------------------     ----------
Indent form              M-C-q   


Documentation commands     Keybinding

Completion help             f12  and C-cC-h
Apropos help                M-f12 and C-cC-a

EMaxima really isn't comparable, since it keeps the Maxima input and
output separate.  So it doesn't really look like a Maxima session.
That's why I wrote MaximaDoc, which would give output that looks like
a Maxima session.
MaximaDoc is interactive, but it only simulates a Maxima session.
batTeX looks like it typesets an actual session, and give the output
in colors!
I've only had the chance to glance at it, but it looks nice.

C-c l in ilisp prompts for a file name, then prompts if you want to
compile the file first.  After which, it loads the file into the
running lisp process.

Doesn't killing the buffer do that already?  It does for me on XEmacs
and a cmulisp process buffer.

    Jay> How do things get messed up?

I think ilisp gets confused sometimes when it tries to parse what the
process returns.  I'm not exactly sure why.  Seems to happen most
often to me when it's trying to be helpful and display some help on
the args needed for the function name I just typed in.  C-z z almost
always cleans it up.

For XEmacs running in X windows (not in terminal mode inside an
xterm), the keys are different.  However, I think in most modes
they're defined to be the same.  However, C-c RET is defined, but C-c
C-m is not for me.

What does "prefix of a built-in function" mean?  In ilisp mode, the
help only pops up for something like:

(destructuring-bind^

where ^ denotes point.  If I press space here, some help for
destructuring-bind pops up.  In no other place does help pop up by
itself.

It's not that important.  I was just stating what ilisp does.

If you want an array of gensyms, you could do something
like this

block([a],a[1]:?gensym(),a[2]:?gensym() , .....   do something with them...);

Okay, C-cC-l won't compile the Maxima file, but it will load it.

I guess it does, I had problems with something similar in the past.
At any rate, killing the buffer will set inferior-maxima-process (the
name maxima-mode uses) to nil.

That must be a difference between Emacs and XEmacs.

is maxima.el with some new keybindings, to make it more consistent

maxima-font-lock.el has been slightly changed, to handle numbers

And emaxima.el and maximadoc.el have been fixed so that they can

If they seem to work for whoever tries them out, I'd like to commit

I just compiled the latest cvs maxima, and I thought I'd report
success.  I've not yet tried all that much, but plot3d worked with
clisp in xmaxima.  Yess!  Nice work Vadim!

Paulo, how is the inclusion of the stuff from the old Macsyma
documentation coming?  No rush, but I'd be kind of nice to have that in
before about mid-December so I can do some more work on it over the
break without having to worry about duplicating effort.  Or is there
any way I could give you a hand?

Also, Jay, would it be OK to include the contents of the Emaxima mode
documentation in the User Manual, maybe with a few changes to make it
fit into the overall setup there?  I have a feeling this is going to
become a major part of the main Maxima package, come 5.9, and well
worth adding to the Emacs section of the interfaces section.

I have the following function

so in the binding in the variable block, lamdaSum is not expanded, and
outside the block it is.
Since I need the expanded form, I need to know which behavior is
correct, and if the unexpanded
one is, then how can I convert to the expanded form, in case the
behavior changes in the future.

I don't think we should write off GCL unless we have to.  It's still
significantly faster than Clisp and runs on many more platforms than
CMUCL.  Of course, without a maintainer, gcl is orphaned at best, but
we should try to keep maxima working on gcl as best we can.

I took the most basic of shots at getting emaxima to run in Windows,
and I'm having no luck.  I copied the files into site-lisp and added
the hooks to .emacs, but it didn't recognise the command M-x maxima.  I
actually know very little about Emacs for Windows, so I'll have to call
for help here.  Has anyone else had any luck? 

Also, on a related note, I took a look at the maxima binary for windows
and it doesn't seem like it's possible to run it from the DOS terminal,
at least not properly.  Here's what I get when I try it:

  z:make_array('any,torder+1),
  lamdaSum:sum('lamda[i]*pvar^i,i,0,torder),
  zSum1:sum('z[i]*pvar^i,i,0,torder)*lamdaSum,
  zSum:sum('z[i]*pvar^i,i,0,torder),
  zSum:lamdaSum*zSum,
  print(zSum,zSum1)
  );
 
its' well.
(C25) f(2,e);

	 2			     2
(lamda  e  + lamda  e + lamda ) (z  e  + z  e + z )

IIRC, netmath uses a number of programs not just maxima. If you meant
direction field plotting, that is probably done with dfplot. Netmath
also uses pari-gp ,octave and gap.

We aren't dropping GCL, but we will no longer rely on it. That's all. In
order for GCL to remain a viable option beyond the near future, someone
will have to take over its maintenance.

clisp-2.27 was the one I used.  I didn't have any problems - the only
odd behavior is that the startup for Clisp itself appears in the
terminal, not in the xmaxima window.  That doesn't matter, though - it
worked fine anyway.

Subject: [Maxima] make_array behavior
Message-ID: <3BFBF3A3.3E2F5581@ieee.org>

It seems that array's declared with make_array are treated differently
then normal maxima variables.
Results with them don't seem to be simplified and using them in a
depends statement creates a error.
Arrays created with array work differently, but they are created in the
global name space so,
if there is a variable z globally, array(z,2) works, but depends(z,t)
doesnt.

Also apply_nouns does not seem to function in the windows
implementation, which I tried to
use first.  I am aware that 'z[i] is not evaluated but if it isnt
quoted, sum of course returns 0.
Is it possible to keep a array created with array out of the global name
space?
I need to work with arrays so that each element can be treated as a
symbol.  Is there a different
idiom that I need to use?
Thanks,
Dan Stanger

With the following function
f():= block([t,

Message-ID: <20011121201206.35662.qmail@web12206.mail.yahoo.com>

Well, in an extremely unstable and limited sort of way, and thanks to
Moses, I've gotten M-x maxima to work in Windows.  I'm having serious
problems - the first few times I try the command after a reboot, it
just hangs emacs.  Eventually, however, for reasons know only to
itself, it starts to work.  I haven't got emaxima to work, nor do
plot3d and ode2 work, but at least it's something.  If anyone else has
had more luck and feels like writing up all the gory details of how you
got it to work, that would be much appreciated.  I've got a screenshot
of my point of maximum progress here:

I am almost finished. There was a lot of work because the original files
from Fateman and another guy where in TROFF ... after the TeX
conversion,
etc ... I am inserting some of the stuff we talked about in here and 
"The Maxima Book" should be finished before this Thanksgiving is over
...

this is OK.
My answer is 

(C1) display2d:false;

(D1) FALSE
(C2) 
(D2) f():=BLOCK([t,z,zz],z:MAKE_ARRAY('ANY,2),
       PRINT(SUM('DIFF('z[i],t),i,0,1)),
       zz:RATSUBST(COS(t),'z[0],SUM('DIFF('z[i],t),i,0,1)),PRINT(zz),
       EV(zz,DIFF))
(C3) f();

'DIFF('z[1],t,1)+'DIFF('z[0],t,1) 
'DIFF(COS(t),t,1)+'DIFF('z[1],t,1) 
(D3) -SIN(t)
(C4) arrays;

(D4) []
(C5) values;
(D5) []

OK.
But your problem is not easy to explain.
I translate your source,s3.mc to lisp.(nouns->diff)
(C10) translate_file("s3.mc");
So I look at s3.LISP,find that $RATSUBST at $EV is not expand.
This is a point that $RATSUBST must be expand to MFUNCTION-CALL
$RATSUBST,like as at first $print correctly. So I intend to use
local variable zz.
There is a difference between maxima-5.5 and maxima-5.6 at lisp level $EV.  
According to manual,Ev is Definitions for Command Line.
This means that args is not  evaled befor handling.
In Command Line this done by displa.
We need to know lisp level maxima for understanding this way.
For instance,
[a,b] is translated to ((MLIST SIMP) |$a| |$b|).
but you get error at command line,:lisp ((MLIST SIMP) |$a| |$b|);
(displa '((MLIST SIMP) |$a| |$b|)) is OK



 (D12) f():=BLOCK([t,z:MAKE_ARRAY('ANY,2)],PRINT(SUM('DIFF('z[i],t),i,0,1)),
	PRINT(RATSUBST(COS(t),'z[0],SUM('DIFF('z[i],t),i,0,1))))
(C13) f();

'DIFF('z[1],t,1)+'DIFF('z[0],t,1) 
'DIFF(COS(t),t,1)+'DIFF('z[1],t,1) 
(D13) 'DIFF(COS(t),t,1)+'DIFF('z[1],t,1)
(C14) Ev(%,diff);

(D14) -SIN(t)

(C15) to_lisp();
MAXIMA>(trace DISPLA)
MAXIMA>(run)
(C16) D13;

  1> (DISPLA ((MLABLE) $D16
              ((MPLUS SIMP)

By this substitution after evaluate $RATSUBST,

maxima-5.6 more mysterious ,but work.
(SIMPLIFY (MFUNCTION-CALL $PRINT |$zz|))
         (MEVAL '(($EV (5 "s3.mc" SRC)) |$zz| $DIFF)
I prefer maxima-5.5 at this point.

Message-ID: <3BFC8500.21B898BE@ieee.org>

Is there a simple way to cause solve to assign to variables or to use
the list returned by
solve to do assignments?  For example solve returns returns the list [
a[1] = 2] where
a[1] is the variable I am solving for.  However, I want to assign a[1]
the value 2.

I am using

      map(lambda([eq],block([l:lhs(eq),r:rhs(eq),a,s],
                 a:part(l,0),s:part(l,1),
                 arraymake(a,[s])::r)),
        sol)

which works, but is dependent on the solution being a array variable.
Is there a better way?

With the latest CVS compiled under clisp-2.27 when doing load
on several packages, eg, fourie, ineq, vect, kach, functs, desol,
I get the following:

(C3) load(fourie);

*** - FUNCALL: argument (LAMBDA (U) (MEMQ U '(T NIL))) is not a
function.
To get a function in the current environment, write (FUNCTION ...).
To get a function in the global environment, write (COERCE
'... 'FUNCTION).
1. Break [17]>

But with maxima-pre59 compiled under gcl-2.4.0 all these packages load.  
Is this a problem with Clisp or am I doing something wrong?

Hi - I've been able to use Windows Maxima with NT Emacs, although I have not
explored all of the details.  In short, I use Moses Glasner's batch file
after starting a shell subprocess in Emacs (i.e., M-x shell followed by 
c:\maxima\maxima.bat).  This is fine for command line work, but plotting is
not available (I am not sufficiently familiar with Emacs to get it to
recognize that Tk takes care of the graphical aspects of Maxima).  Also,
there is no problem in shutting down Maxima.  BTW, I am using an NT machine
with 512Mb memory.  Hope this helps...

It is Maxima problem with Clisp. Clisp is more restrictive (and more
standard  compliant as far as I understand) and treats, say,
  (apply '(lambda (u) (print u)) '((1 2 3)))
as an error. Clisp requires explicit object of function type in funcall like
  (apply #'(lambda (u) (print u)) '((1 2 3)))
In GCL both constructions are OK.
So we have to patch Maxima.

The trouble is caused by
  define_varaibe(foo,true,boolean);
The patch to trmode.lisp is attached.

Even After Vadim's patch, I am getting similar error messages:

Type-error in KERNEL::OBJECT-NOT-LIST-ERROR-HANDLER:  LAMBDA is not of type 
LIST

Restarts:
  0: [MACSYMA-QUIT] Macsyma top-level

Debug  (type H for help)

(MAPPLY1 (LAMBDA (#:G1010) (DECLARE #) (COND # #))
         (2)
         (LAMBDA (#:G1010) (DECLARE #) (COND # #))
         NIL)
Source:
; File: /home/Osman/osman/maxima-pre59/src/mlisp.lisp
(CAAR FN)

I checked mlisp.lisp and at line 2393:
 (LIST '(LAMBDA) (CONS '(MLIST) ARGS) BODY))
                                              
How do we make this list into a "function" use COERCE ?

Thanks
Osman

It looks like a different problem. Could you clarify in which
situation this error occurs.

This happens when I run symmgrp.max (lie symmetry code) with  s_kar1.com  as 
input.

maxima-cmu < s_kar1.com

If you want I can email you the maxima source (single file 27K)

Attached is a first pass of Lindstedt code, which has the same calling
sequence as the commercial
function, for inclusion in the maxima project.  I gave it the LGPL, but
I can change that to the
GPL if required.  I would appreciate any comments about my coding style,
as well as other
comments.

Is anyone working on a groebner code in maxima, or does anyone know if
the code written
by Gail Zacharias which was contributed to the commercial code is
available?

I think at least one
version of Gail's code was written for the pre-1982 macsyma.
Has it been lost?
For some reason your message with subject "Linstedt" is
not coming through my mail reader.  So far as I know
there were a few papers on this topic but it is rather
difficult to fully automate. (almost any asymptotic methods
tend to require a steady hand on the tiller...)

The commands plot2d, plot3d sent to maxima from NTEmacs do not manage to
call tcl but they do create the data file maxout.openmath in the
working directory. The following will produce graphical output

1. A windows clone of the unix cat command needs to installed
   and also TCL (available from tcl.activestate.com).
2. cat.exe, wish.exe, wish84.exe need to be in the PATH.
3. If you are using the precompiled maxima-5.5beta, then you need
   to get omplotdata from  maxima-5.6/bin.
3. move the most recently created maxout.openmath to 
   maxima/bin and run the following command from 
   cmdproxy.exe, or cmd.exe in maxima/bin:  
                    omplotdata maxout.openmath
4. with maxima-5.5beta, it is possible to omplotdata to executed
   automatically but with maxima-5.6 it seems necessary to use
   cmd.exe or cmdproxy.exe to execute it.

But IMHO it is better to run maxima under a unix system.

Subject: [Maxima] Emaxima questions/bug report
Message-ID: <20011126203318.91596.qmail@web12202.mail.yahoo.com>

I took a wack at including the Emaxima documentation in the manual this
weekend, and after many silly errors I think I finally discovered a
problem.  Emaxima doesn't seem to play well with the multicol package. 
When I have a regular multicol in the document, and include maxima
stuff as well, here's what happens:

\new at pdflink ...Hy at SaveLastskip \pdfdest name {#1}
                                                  \@pdfview
\Hy at RestoreLasts...
l.61 \newpage
              [1]
! Use of \dom at ximaverbatim doesn't match its definition.
\prepare at multicols ...topskip \z@ \null }\output {
                                                  \global \setbox
\partial at p...
l.65 \begin
           {tabbing}

Anyone have any ideas as to how to resolve the conflict?  It works fine
if I comment out the multicol stuff, but I'd kinda like to be able to
use both.

Also, would there be any way to add into emaxima mode the ability to
generate sessions of the kind that batlatex does, so we can have all
the abilities in one package?

I'll look at it, but can you provide an example file?

It'd be easy to add sessions like maximadoc, at least. I'll take care
of it when I get the chance. (Soon, I hope.)  Perhaps maximadoc should
be removed, then.  As for making it more like batlatex, I'll see what
I can do.

Sure - see attached file.  For me this produces the error.

Hello,
 
I have a strange problem with the 'Romberg' function:
I try
 
MyFun(a,b,c,d):=ROMBERG(a,b,c,d);
 
and then
 
MyFun(SIN(x),x,0,6.28);
 
This results in an error message:
Error: ((%SIN SIMP) is not of type (OR RATIONAL LISP::FLOAT).
Fast links are on.
etc.
 
Can anybody give me a simple solution/explanation for this?
Another question, partly related: Some functions (among them ROMBERG)
produce an error, when nonnumeric arguments are given.
I would prefer to get the noun form instead. For example:
 
INTEGRATE(a(x),x,lower,upper) => INTEGRATE(a(x),x,lower,upper)
 
but
 
ROMBERG(a(x),x,lower,upper) => error message.
 
I'd appreciate any help on this. 
I tried to write a wrapper function 
MyRomberg(a,b,c,d):=block(if(is(numberp(c) and numberp(d)) then
return(romberg(a,b,c,d)) else return(fundef(MyRomberg,[a,b,c,d])))
to handle non-numeric arguments, but this lead to the first problem :-(
 
Regards
 
Markus

Hi Markus
   
Romberg function is macsyma macro,so we can not know How evaluated(or
treated)is a,b,c unless read a source.
But Romberg(a,b,c) is simple.
a is treated as quated function name.
So 
(C1) MyFun(a,b,c):=romberg(a,b,c) $
(C2) MyFun('SIN,0,6.28);
(D2)   5.073086625254864E-6
or
(C3) MyFun(sin,0,6.28); work same
(C4) v(x):=exp(x)$
(C5) MyFun('v,0,1.0);
(D6) 1.71828184221844

MyFun(v,0,1.0) work,but I think it is not good style.
Romberg(a,b,c,d) is more difficut.
thanks.(I appreciate  your work for Symaxx)

Subject: [Maxima] More accurate Bessel functions
Message-ID: <4nlmgqsujc.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

--=-=-=


FWIW, here is a patch for more accurate bessel functions.  It should
be a relatively safe patch because it only modifies j[0]-bessel,
j[1]-bessel, i[0]-bessel, and i[1]-bessel.  I've tested some random
values and they appear to match the tables in A&S to the last digit or
so. 

As mentioned earlier, this is a translation of some routines from TOMS
715 via f2cl and therefore includes some of the macros used by f2cl.

It would be possible to remove the use of the f2cl macros, but I'd
rather not.

Ray

Subject: [Maxima] More accurate gamma and erf functions
Message-ID: <4nherestd1.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

--=-=-=


Here is a patch for more accurate gamma and erf functions.

The gamma routine is Lanczos algorithm so it's valid for complex
arguments too. http://winnie.fit.edu/~gabdo/gamma.txt is a nice
description of the algorithm used here.

The erf routine is a hand-modified version of an f2cl conversion of
the erf routine in TOMS 715.

I've checked these against the tables in A&S.  They match well.

Ray

Subject: [Maxima] Error conditions for maxima vs commercial code.
Message-ID: <3C05495B.255FC034@ieee.org>

I am planing to implement second thru tenth functions.  If these
functions are called with
incorrect arguments how important is it to mimic the behavior of the
commercial code.
For example if second is called with a single element list, it prints
the error message
there is no SECOND element, and returns the input argument.  I was
planing to implement
these functions with rest, which would change their error messages.

In general, how important is it for us to conform to the same error
handling of the commercial code.

The problem was that multicol uses \output, so when EMaxima redefined
\output, it caused errors when multicol was used.
So I changed EMaxima so it doesn't use \output anymore.
I changed all variables to make sure they contain some form of
"maxima", so there shouldn't be any more conflicts.
Cells now begin and end with
\beginmaxima
and
\endmaxima,
and output is separated by
\maximaoutput
or
\maximatexoutput
I also changed the keybindings for emaxima-toggle-init (now C-c C-t)
and emaxima-send-cell (now C-c C-v), since the old ones conflicted
with AucTeX.

emaxima-mode now has session cells, which begin and end with
\beginmaximasession
and 
\endmaximasession
and will result in the input and output being together with the Maxima
prompts.  (It doesn't yet do the nice colors and TeX output that
batlatex does, though.)

The files
emaxima.el and emaxima.sty
are the ones that were changed, and the intro
EMIntro.ps
has been updated.
They're at
ftp://vh213601.truman.edu/pub/Maxima

Hello,
 
I'm looking for a Maxima command to calculate the numerical derivative of an
expression.
Of course, I can just calculate the slope (f(x2)-f(x1))/(x2-x1). But I
wonder, if there is a built-in function, where I don't have to worry
about the distance between x2 and x1.
Can anybody point me to the right man-page? :-)
 
Regards
 
Markus

I've been trying that out, and so far it looks excellent.  Do you think
there is any way to add the TeX stuff at some point in the future?  If
so, I can shift entirely to emaxima for doing manual stuff.  No big
deal in any case - this is really excellent work.

So far, in trying the session environment out, I've stumbled onto one
thing that should probably be fixed - if a quit(); command is included
in a session it hangs emacs.  Granted that probably won't be a command
included real often, but still it should probably fail cleanly.

We all owe you a vote of thanks for the magnificent work you've been
doing here, Jay.  I've little doubt this will become the standard
maxima interface for the forseeable future.

The only real problem is in adding a switch to Maxima which will have
the output automatically in TeX form, and being able to switch back to
ascii form.  (Actually, if it could be switched to TeX form but not
switched back, that would be something.)
imaxima.lisp does this, but the output isn't quite what is needed for
EMaxima.  I think imaxima.lisp could be twiddled a bit, though, to get
it to work.  If so, adding the TeX shouldn't be hard.  I'll look at it
when I get the chance.  (I'm not sure when; fairly soon, I hope.)

Okay, I think I got it fixed.  (It's late, I may have missed
something...)  I tried to fix it by having Emacs look at the status of
the Maxima process, but I didn't get that to work.  So I did something
less elegant, I had Emacs look for a quit(); or a ^D being sent to
Maxima, and in that case take care of the situation.  Then there was a
problem if you tried to do something (move the cursor, etc.) after a
cell with a quit(); was sent but before the output came back, so I have
Emacs sleep for a second in that situation.  Not the best solution,
but it seems to work for now.

Oops, I had previously added to the kill-buffer-hook for the Maxima
process buffer a kill-process command, but if the process was killed
before the buffer is, the hook tried to kill the process again.  I
fixed it now.

The changes are in maxima.el and emaxima.el in

@section Introduction to Lists
Lists are the basic building block for maxima and lisp.   All data types
other than arrays, hash tables, numbers are represented as lisp lists,
These lisp lists have the form
@example
((mplus) $A 2)
@end example
@noindent
to indicate an expression @code{A+2}.   At maxima level one would see
the infix notation @code{A+2}.   Maxima also has lists which are printed
as
@example
[1, 2, 7, x+y]
@end example
@noindent
for a list with 4 elements.   Internally this corresponds to a lisp list
of the form
@example
((mlist) 1  2  7  ((mplus)  $X $Y ))
@end example
@noindent
The flag which denotes the type field of the maxima expression is a list
itself, since after it has been through the simplifier the list would become
@example
((mlist simp) 1 2 7 ((mplus simp) $X $Y))
@end example


@c end concepts Lists

@node Definitions for Lists,  , Introduction to Lists, Lists
@section Definitions for Lists

@c @node APPEND, ATOM, Lists, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun APPEND (list1, list2, ...)
returns a single list of the elements of
list1 followed by the elements of list2,...  APPEND also works on
general expressions, e.g. APPEND(F(A,B), F(C,D,E)); -> F(A,B,C,D,E).
Do EXAMPLE(APPEND); for an example.

@end defun
@c @node ATOM, CONS, APPEND, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun ATOM (exp)
is TRUE if exp is atomic (i.e. a number or name) else
FALSE.  Thus ATOM(5) is TRUE while ATOM(A[1]) and ATOM(SIN(X)) are
FALSE.  (Assuming A[1] and X are unbound.)

@end defun
@c @node CONS, COPYLIST, ATOM, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun CONS (exp, list)
returns a new list constructed of the element exp as
its first element, followed by the elements of list.  CONS also works
on other expressions, e.g. CONS(X, F(A,B,C));  ->  F(X,A,B,C).

@end defun
@c @node COPYLIST, DELETE, CONS, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun COPYLIST (L)
creates a copy of the list L.

@end defun
@c @node DELETE, ENDCONS, COPYLIST, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun DELETE (exp1, exp2)
removes all occurrences of exp1 from exp2.  Exp1
may be a term of exp2 (if it is a sum) or a factor of exp2 (if it is a
product).
@example
(C1)  DELETE(SIN(X),X+SIN(X)+Y);
(D1)               Y + X

@end example
DELETE(exp1, exp2, integer) removes the first integer occurrences of
exp1 from exp2.  Of course, if there are fewer than integer
occurrences of exp1 in exp2 then all occurrences will be deleted.

@end defun
@c @node ENDCONS, FIRST, DELETE, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun ENDCONS (exp, list)
returns a new list consisting of the elements of
list followed by exp.  ENDCONS also works on general expressions, e.g.
ENDCONS(X, F(A,B,C));  ->  F(A,B,C,X).

@end defun
@c @node FIRST, GET, ENDCONS, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun FIRST (exp) SECOND (exp) .. TENTH (exp)
yields the first part of exp which may result in the first
element of a list, the first row of a matrix, the first term of a sum,
etc.  Note that FIRST and its related functions, REST and LAST, work
on the form of exp which is displayed not the form which is typed on
input.  If the variable INFLAG [FALSE] is set to TRUE however, these
functions will look at the internal form of exp.  Note that the
simplifier re-orders expressions.  Thus FIRST(X+Y) will be X if INFLAG
is TRUE and Y if INFLAG is FALSE.  (FIRST(Y+X) gives the same
results).  The functions SECOND .. TENTH yield the second through the
tenth part of their input argument.

@end defun
@c @node GET, LAST, FIRST, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun GET (a, i)
retrieves the user property indicated by i associated with
atom a or returns FALSE if a doesn't have property i.
@example
(C1) PUT(%E,'TRANSCENDENTAL,'TYPE);
(D1) 			        TRANSCENDENTAL
(C2) PUT(%PI,'TRANSCENDENTAL,'TYPE)$
(C3) PUT(%I,'ALGEBRAIC,'TYPE)$
(C4) TYPEOF(EXP) := BLOCK([Q],
                        IF NUMBERP(EXP)
                        THEN RETURN('ALGEBRAIC),
                        IF NOT ATOM(EXP)
                        THEN RETURN(MAPLIST('TYPEOF, EXP)),
                        Q : GET(EXP, 'TYPE),
                        IF Q=FALSE
			THEN ERRCATCH(ERROR(EXP,"is not numeric.")) ELSE Q)$
(C5) TYPEOF(2*%E+X*%PI);
X is not numeric.
(D5) 	     [[TRANSCENDENTAL, []], [ALGEBRAIC, TRANSCENDENTAL]]
(C6) TYPEOF(2*%E+%PI);
(D6) 	        [TRANSCENDENTAL, [ALGEBRAIC, TRANSCENDENTAL]]


@end example
@end defun
@c @node LAST, LENGTH, GET, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun LAST (exp)
yields the last part (term, row, element, etc.) of the exp.

@end defun
@c @node LENGTH, LISTARITH, LAST, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun LENGTH (exp)
gives (by default) the number of parts in the external
(displayed) form of exp.  For lists this is the number of elements,
for matrices it is the number of rows, and for sums it is the number
of terms. (See DISPFORM).  The LENGTH command is affected by the
INFLAG switch [default FALSE].  So, e.g. LENGTH(A/(B*C)); gives 2 if
INFLAG is FALSE (Assuming EXPTDISPFLAG is TRUE), but 3 if INFLAG is
TRUE (the internal representation is essentially A*B^-1*C^-1).

@end defun
@c @node LISTARITH, LISTP, LENGTH, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defvar LISTARITH
 default: [TRUE] - if FALSE causes any arithmetic operations
with lists to be suppressed; when TRUE, list-matrix operations are
contagious causing lists to be converted to matrices yielding a result
which is always a matrix.  However, list-list operations should return
lists.

@end defvar
@c @node LISTP, MAKELIST, LISTARITH, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun LISTP (exp)
is TRUE if exp is a list else FALSE.

@end defun
@c @node MAKELIST, MEMBER, LISTP, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun MAKELIST (exp,var,lo,hi)
returns a list as value.  MAKELIST may be called as
MAKELIST(exp,var,lo,hi) ["lo" and "hi" must be integers], or as
MAKELIST(exp,var,list).  In the first case MAKELIST is analogous to
SUM, whereas in the second case MAKELIST is similar to MAP.  Examples:
@example
   MAKELIST(CONCAT(X,I),I,1,6) yields [X1,X2,X3,X4,X5,X6]
   MAKELIST(X=Y,Y,[A,B,C]) yields [X=A,X=B,X=C]
@end example

@end defun
@c @node MEMBER, REST, MAKELIST, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun MEMBER (exp, list)
returns TRUE if exp occurs as a member of list (not
within a member).  Otherwise FALSE is returned.  Member also works on
non-list expressions, e.g. MEMBER(B, F(A,B,C));  ->  TRUE.

@end defun
@c @node REST, REVERSE, MEMBER, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec 
@defun REST (exp, n)
yields exp with its first n elements removed if n is
positive and its last -n elements removed if n is negative.  If n is 1
it may be omitted.  Exp may be a list, matrix, or other expression.

@end defun
@c @node REVERSE,  , REST, Lists
@c @unnumberedsec  
@defun REVERSE (list)
reverses the order of the members of the list (not
the members themselves).  REVERSE also works on general expressions,
e.g.  REVERSE(A=B); gives B=A.
REVERSE default: [FALSE] - in the Plotting functions, if TRUE cause a
left-handed coordinate system to be assumed.

@end defun

I would say "not very." I might feel differently if commercial code was

Dan,

Thank you very much for your contribution.

Everyone else,

Please note Dan's exemplary behavior in contributing to Maxima. He has
supplied code + tests + documentation. 

I would like to this contribution into the 5.9 series. I hope 5.9.0 will
happen before Christmas.

One question we might want to put forth in connection with that subject
is how many people out there have stuff which would require such
conforming in order to work?  Also, was/is the error handling of the
commerical system better than what we currently have?

I think that the error handling from the commercial code
is not very well designed, though it may be better than
maxima's.

I think that every error message possible should be logged
in some way, with an explanation of what might have caused
it.  It therefore helps to have a unique word or number
as a prefix, so they can be sorted.

Some errors in macsyma throw you into a lisp break, which
is probably not what most people want.  There is some
debugmode:true option, but that may not be what people
want either.

By the way, it occurred to me that there may be some
other users of the name Maxima for software.  There
are several I found in 2 minutes with Google.  a CAD tool,
a router tool, an animation tool, a middleware package.
There is also a Nissan automobile model.

Just thought you should know.

I would like to see a list which also contains the functions
that can cause the error, so that a user could trace them to
possibly debug their problem.  Is there a lisp cross referencer
that could take the code and produce a list of all functions that
call merror and their arguments, in such a way that this could be
easily constructed?
Regarding our name, maybe the fsf could trademark the name maxima
in the context of computer algebra systems, to avoid problems.

That sounds good.  Two issues come to mind - how best to handle it
within maxima, and whether or not each package included in maxima
should have to also integrate itself into the error system first.  My
thought on the second is that it should if it is to be included in the
main distro, and that means the system needs to be well thought out and
structured, to minimize the effort involved.  I readily admit ignorance
of this - is there a "correct" way to set up such a system?

I think lisp mode, at least for beginners like myself, doesn't help in
the least - it just generates more confusion.

Hmm... do you think we should try to find a name no one has used yet? 
My guess would be since none of those software products are in the
mathematical software game they are different enough not to cause
confusion, but that's just my guess.  I know KIllustrator got into
trouble, but I think that was because they were trying to do something
similar to Adobe Illustrator.

Oh, I've been meaning to ask you about that large list of integrals you
have on you web page - what exactly does expt do?  Is it different from
exp?  I've been thinking it might be worth the trouble to convert that
file into a maxima batch file, to use for test purposes, but I'm not
sure what the best way would be.  Is anyone familiar with the current
make test setup?

(exp x)   is e^x   or   %e^x in macsyma
(expt x y) is  x^y.

Yes,  (expt %e x)  is (exp x).

I probably have it as a Mathematica file and a Macsyma file.

Okay, it's been added.  Let me know if the output looks acceptable.
I stole shamelessy from battex and imaxima, by the way.
You need the latest maxima.el, emaxima.el, emaxima.sty and
emaxima.lisp.  emaxima.lisp needs to be somewhere in the emacs
load-path.  I added a few lines of documentation in EMintro.ps
(although I forgot to mention emaxima.lisp there, I'll fix that
later). If emacs can't find emaxima.lisp, then any TeX updating will
be silently replaced by non-TeX updating.  It's in
ftp://vh213601.truman.edu/pub/Maxima/

Could the name Macsyma be (re-) claimed, perhaps as GNU Macsyma?
After all, the code *is* derived from original MIT Macsyma. And if
Macsyma Inc should sue for trademark infringement, I guess they would
have to prove they have an actual product - which would not be a bad
thing.

Message-ID: <3C09E4D7.2040405@verizon.net>

Hopefully someone on this mailing list can help me with my newbie problem.

I get the error below when running make on the most recent version of gcl out of cvs repository.  I get the same error for gcl 2.4.  I am running RH 7.2 (kernel 2.4.7-10) and have tried gcc 2.95-4 and 3.0.2.  Both gave the same error: 

make[1]: Entering directory `/download/gcl/unixport'

make[1]: Leaving directory `/download/gcl/unixport'

A seemingly identical error was posted on this mailing list in July of 2001, and the proposed solution was to use the most recent version out of cvs (http://www.ma.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2001/000197.html).  Unfortunatelly, this solution does not seem to work for me.

As a workaournd solution, does anyone know where I could download a precompiled gcl 2.4?  I looked for it on the rpmfind.net, but the most recent version of gcl on it was 2.2. 

Thanks for your help.

Some time ago I wrote some problems with "itensor.lisp". 
Namely the problem was that procedure "components(tensor,comps) does not work
So I have, e.g.
(C1) load("itensor.lisp");

Loading itensor.lisp
Finished loading itensor.lisp
(D1)                             itensor.lisp
(C2)  show(f([],[i]))$

                                       i
(D2)                                  f
(C3) (remcomps(f), components(f([],[j]),density([],[])*velocity([],[j])))$

(C4)  show(f([],[i]))$

                                       i
(D4)                                  f
(C5) 

Instead 
                                           i
(D4)                       density velocity  
By chance, I have an access to commercial macsyma here (far outside of my home), 
and there everything's fine! Exelent, I would say.
There is now CAS with the same abilities.

I tried to search what is going on in "itensor.lisp". I'm a newbie in lisp and please
excuse me a stupid question. I did not find in textbooks definitions for
ZL-GET, ZL-ASSOC and ML-TYPEP 

The procedure is following
DEFMFUN $COMPONENTS (TENSOR COMP)
  ((LAMBDA (LEN1 LEN2 NAME PROP)
    (COND ((OR (NOT (RPOBJ TENSOR))(CDDDR TENSOR))
	   (merror "Improper 1st arg to COMPONENTS: ~M"
		   TENSOR
		   )))
    (SETQ LEN1 (LENGTH (CDADR TENSOR)) LEN2 (LENGTH (CDADDR TENSOR)))
    (AND (NOT (ATOM COMP))(EQ (CAAR COMP) '$MATRIX)
	 (COND ((= (f+ LEN1 LEN2) 2)(SETQ NAME (GENSYM))
		(SET NAME COMP)(SETQ COMP NAME))
	       (T 
		(merror "Needs two indices for COMPONENTS from matrix:~%~M"
			TENSOR))))
    (COND ((AND (EQ (ML-TYPEP COMP) 'SYMBOL) (> (f+ LEN1 LEN2) 0))
	   (SETQ PROP 'CARRAYS))
	  ((SAMELISTS (SETQ NAME (APPEND (CDADR TENSOR) (CDADDR TENSOR)))
		      (CDADR ($INDICES COMP)))
	   (SETQ PROP 'TEXPRS COMP (CONS COMP NAME)))
	  (T (merror "Args to COMPONENTS do not have the same free indices")))
    (SETQ TENSOR (CAAR TENSOR) LEN1 (CONS LEN1 LEN2))
    (COND ((AND (SETQ NAME (ZL-GET TENSOR PROP))
		(SETQ LEN2 (ZL-ASSOC LEN1 NAME))) (RPLACD LEN2 COMP))
	  (T (PUTPROP TENSOR (CONS (CONS LEN1 COMP) NAME) PROP)))
    (OR (ZL-GET TENSOR 'INDEXED) ($INDEXED TENSOR))
    '$DONE) NIL NIL NIL NIL))

I found that the problem reported earlier by Osman
is causes by simple construction

MATCHDECLARE(a,SCALARP)$
MATCHDECLARE(b,TRUE)$
DEFMATCH(tst,a*b)$
tst(x);

On GCL it works but on CLISP and CMUCL it
produces error saying that CAR of LAMBDA
is impossible.

There is two ways to fix the problem. First, to modify
functions makepreds, defmatch1 (matcom.lisp) which
form lambda expression for the function tst.
Unfortunately my attempt to make them return
#'(lambda ...) instead of '(lambda ...) failed.
It seems that these functions are supposed to produce
list and if I replace their value it by #'(labmda ...)
it immediately causes errors in other pieces of code
when Maxima tries to get CAR/CDR of  it.

So, I suggest other method to fix the problem. These
lambda expressions are actually evaluated by the function
mapplay1 (mlisp.lisp). The following modification
to this function does the job

Subject: [Maxima] Maxima and TeXmacs
Message-ID: <Pine.SGI.4.10.10112031305180.6233009-100000@Sky.inp.nsk.su>

Hello *,

I am new to this list. Sorry if I'll say something which was already
discussed.

Maxima can be used via a number of interfaces: from the command line,
xmaxima, from emacs... One more way to use it is via TeXmacs. Maxima can
produce its output in the LaTeX form, and TeXmacs renders it on the fly,
giving an excellent quality of graphical formula output. For those who
like graphical formula input (in Mathematica), recent versions of TeXmacs
can do it, too. The combination Maxima + TeXmacs can provide a GUI
computer algebra environment which can compete with Mathematica, and even
has a better quality of output.

Unfortunately, at the moment this interface (written by myself) is, to put
it mildly, brittle. I'd like to ask a few questions and make a few
suggestions about possible improvements in Maxima input-output, which can
make the life much easier for me, and, probably, for those who write other
interfaces to Maxima. The main problem is: the text output from Maxima
lacks much of the structure which was present inside, and the interface
has to do a lot of work to reconstruct it; it would be much easier to
preserve this structure during output.

The main thing any interface must know is: what piece of output is a
prompt, i.e., immediately preceeds an input? In texmacs.lisp, I redefined
MAIN-PROMPT, and the interface has no problem recognizing (C1) prompts.
But when a break prompt is generated (MAXIMA>> in GCL), the interface does
not recognize it, and hangs. Is it possible to redefine the break prompt?
It seems Lisp-system specific; how to do it in GCL? in clisp? Similarly,
when a user uses describe(something);, a prompt asking to input one or
several numbers appear. How to redefine it? (again, it seems
Lisp-specific). It would be great, generally, to have some function (say,
PROMPT) which is exclusively used to produce pieces of output immediately
preceeding input. Then it could be redefined once and for all, and there
would be no need to patch individual commands like, e.g., entermatrix.

Another problem: when a line of input is not a complete statement, Maxima
waits for more input without any prompting. TeXmacs interface hangs,
because it waits for a prompt. It would be very good to modify the Maxima
reader in such a way that it calls some PROMPT when it reads a newline
inside a statement. This prompt may be empty by default, but it should be
redefinable.

When I wrote texmacs.lisp, I found and fixed many bugs in mactex.lisp. I
sent a patch to Bill Schelter, and he replied that my bug fixes will be
encorporated into the development version of Maxima. I don't know if they
are really in the development tree or not. I think that some more things
from texmacs.lisp should be incorporated in the mainline Maxima sources,
e.g., a patch to DISPLA which forces Maxima to output everything in LaTeX
if $DISPLAY2D has some value, and some more stuff. It can be useful for
other interface writers.

Best wishes,
Andrey

Subject: [Maxima] calling defmspec functions in Lisp
Message-ID: <OFDA73F505.334C901C-ON86256B17.005C4AE0@unk.edu>

I've defined a Maxima function union by

(defmspec $union (a) blah blah blah)

In Maxima, it works as expected with any number of arguments:

(C1)  union([a,b,c],[x], [y]);

[a,b,c,x,y]

My question is how do I call union from  using Lisp?  For example,
if I attempt to define a function $symmdifference by

(defun $symmdifference (a b)
  (cond ((and ($listp a) ($listp b))
      ($union ($setdifference a b) ($setdifference b a)))
     (t (merror "Both arguments to SYMMDIFFERENCE must be lists"))))

then $union isn't called correctly (the function $setdifference is okay).

Thanks in advance,

Barton

Get the latest CVS sources for plot3d.lisp.   The fix that went in
there for Clisp should also work for CMUCL.

Has anyone noticed that in src/hyp.lisp, maxima defines a function
INTERSECTION?

With Clisp, I get a warning about redefining the COMMON-LISP function
INTERSECTION.  In CMUCL, it is, indeed, redefined so that you can't
use the common-lisp function anymore.

Ray

P.S. Clisp also complains about redefining TYPE-ERROR when running
(save-maxima).

After looking over the code, I think maxima's INTERSECTION is the same
as Lisp's INTERSECTION so it probably shouldn't be defined at all.

Besides, I don't think you're allowed to redefine functions in the
COMMON-LISP package.

sloop.lisp redefines Clisp's type-error function.  The following patch
simply renames it from type-error to sloop-type-error, which is only

Clisp no longer complains about it.

I just downloaded a version of MuPAD 2.0.  The interface
and various other things are worth examining, primarily
because this system was designed AFTER Maple and Mathematica.
I tried it on a Sun/Solaris system.

I do not see any way that it is "breaking new ground"
but it (for example) has a simpler window, a nice font
for documentation, and at least a chance of commiting
errors just to be compatible with previous mistakes.

It seems to be a vague imitation of the Maple interface language.

Does anyone else have a copy?  What do you
think?

I am currently working on converting Dr. Thomasset's program which
converts maple to mupad to produce maxima code.  I have quite a bit
of the syntax done, the semantics is more difficult.

While some parts of the translation are simple, it is not
clear how to handle different scope rules and function call
disciplines.  Maple has a kind of phoney way of returning
multiple values by setting certain trailing parameters as
call by reference  (or maybe even call by name).

Also binding certain values affect global behavior. Like
precision.




Here's another approach, which is NOT easy, but I have
thought about some.
I believe that a parser for Maple could be done by using
a parser generator and the Maple syntax (assuming it is
LALR(1)).  This plus the lexical analysis should take about
10 pages of code.

And then implement the Maple kernel in Lisp. It should
only take 50-100 pages of code.

Then you can take any program written in the Maple
language and run it in Lisp.  You can also make
judicious substitutions in the pseudo kernel of
Maple, e.g. change the way arithmetic is done, or
simplification, etc.

Difficulties:  finding out EXACTLY what the Maple kernel
does is not easy.  (But there is no way around it if
you are going to run Maple programs, regardless of the
syntax... either you implement kernel in Maxima-ese or
Lisp).
Using all that "intermediate" Maple code that belongs to
Maplesoft.

That is, if some contributed "free" code is written to
use some visible but copyrighted Maplesoft Maple-code, one
does not have the rights to use it.  (e.g. the Maple integration
program can be examined by any Maple owner.  It can't legally
be moved to Maxima though.  At least I don't think so.)

For what it is worth, the same technique could be used for
imitating Mathematica except that the language is not LALR(1);
fortunately I wrote a parser that does this.

Writing a Mathematica kernel in lisp is more work, since it
is larger than Maple's kernel, very diffusely scattered, and
fairly secret.  You can, to a limited extent, defeat some
of Mathematica's security by removing the "Protected" attribute
from a function, and then list stuff.  For example, I
got  from ??CosIntegral

its definition in terms of ExpIntegral, and other junk as well

My goal here is not to implement maple, but to convert contributed code,
usable by anyone to
maxima.  I expect the tool to convert the code syntacticly, and by
converting some of the
function calls to maxima ones, most of the semantics.  The most difficult
problem in
conversion is the idioms used in the language, ie: sequences which I am
mapping to lists,
which creates a lot of garbage.  I expect that after the code is
processed, a human still has
to understand the code to produce efficient maxima code.

Hello *,

I am using MuPAD 2.0. By the way, I wrote TeXmacs interface to it. It was
very easy, just a few lines of code, and it is very robust. This is
because MuPAD allows one to customize everything (prompts, output
functions, ...) easily and systematically. No special cases, just general
rules. With Maxima, the situation is quite different: a dozen varieties
of prompts, input and output functions are scattered all over the code
and not easily redefinable, etc.

What about MuPAD language, it mainly follows Maple. Some good data
abstraction mechanisms (domains and categories) are inspired by Axiom.
Unlike Axiom, it is not strongly-typed, and the power of its advanced type
system is not fully used, IMHO. Its help system is based on a (slightly
modified) dvi viewer, and therefore looks good. In the TeXmacs/Maxima
case, TeXmacs is used as the help engine, and provides equally good
quality.

Best wishes,
Andrey

Hmm... There must be some difference - on CMUCL, MAXIMA::INTERSECTION
breaks DEFPACKAGE. I discovered this as I converted
maxima-package.lisp to use DEFPACKAGE. First time loading the
DEFPACKAGE form works fine, second time (after loading the rest of
Maxima) it complains about the number of arguments to INTERSECTION.

Exactly. I'd put it on the shadow list together with COMPLEMENT and
CONTINUE. It is good that CLISP seems to warn about redefining symbols
in the CL package - I'd be surprised if INTERSECTION and TYPE-ERROR
are the only ones.

Feeling slightly heretic today, I'd argue for going ANSI in the
stricter sense [1] and getting rid of SLOOP entirely. In light of
recent c.l.l. discussions on IF*, I'm afraid that a "modern" CL hacker
will have a first look at the Maxima code, exclaim "yuck, they even
use a home grown replacement for ANSI loop", and walk away.

I've tried the SLOOP -> LOOP exercise myself and I'll take this
opportunity to summarise my experience. The diff -rU4 weighs about 24k
and is dominated by stuff like LOOP-RETURN -> RETURN, IN-ARRAY ->
ACROSS and

-  (sloop for (key arg) on keyword-rest-arg by 'cddr
+  (sloop for (key arg) on keyword-rest-arg by #'cddr

The most obscure change was to replace NLEFT with CL:LAST - which is a
good thing (NLEFT was implemented using SLOOP and didn't work with
LOOP). I also had to replace a couple of macros (P-RED and friends)
because they were misused as functions.

Yes, I know I shouldn't fix what is not broken. However, for a
suitable definition of the b-word, SLOOP *is* broken. I do see the
lack of regression tests as a strong argument for not doing changes of
this kind. My SLOOP -> LOOP passes all doc/rtest*.mac but I know
that's far from full coverage.

So do I. 
I have used MuPAD for 4 years. The only problem
is that it is not free (in the sense of freedom).

This is the most important superiority of MuPAD over Maple.
However the price is rather high : the code is slow for 
complicated data structures.

I think what Dan is trying to do is import into maxima some of the
free maple extensions others have contributed. This way, maxima share
libs would grow very quickly :-)

If the same could be done for mathematica ...

Ok, I think I know the problem:  CMUCL's defpackage uses intersection
with the :test keyword option, so maxima's intersection isn't going to
work.

And a closer look shows that maxima's intersection is the same as CL's
intersection if :test #'equal is used (because zl-delete and zl-member
use the #'equal test)

Probably not.  I haven't done a full build in a long while and I don't

That is just about my feeling towards sloop. I also think we should
get rid of all gratuitious deviations from ANSI. Though, as you said,
the lack of a regression test suite makes me feel a bit uneasy.
Maybe we should just find someone who is willing to test and report
bugs. I would, but at the moment haven't got much time to play around
with maxima. Anyone else?

Andreas

I think we should get rid of sloop, but not for the 6.0 release.
Maybe the next one?

And a long time ago I ported an ANSI loop from the CMU AI archives to
gcl, so gcl support won't be hurt.  (Pretty sure the ansi loop is the
very similar to the one in CMUCL, which we could probably use for gcl
too.)

That's a problem, but I'm not sure what else we could do except try it
and let users report problems.

I certainly appreciate the desire to dump SLOOP. I agree, however, that
we shouldn't dump it in the 6.0 release.

Perhaps we should consider a more general ANSI cleanup for the 6.1
series?

That's probably a good idea.  By the way, is it the plan to integrate
the new build system before or after 5.9?

Definitely before. I would like to release 5.9.0 as soon as we've
decided how the file should be (re)arranged and the build system is
ready. The latter is getting close. When it gets a little closer I will
put it in cvs in a separate directory.

For the former (rearranging the files), I have a half-written script
that moves and renames files from maxima-pre59 to the new maxima module.
It also creates a script to do the reverse. Currently they are called
"migrate" and "unmigrate". I was toying with calling them "emigrate" and
"repatriate," but I thought that was a little too opaque. Suggestions
are welcome.

The scripts might sound like overkill, but it provides a way to present
the mapping for discussion. It also makes it 100% clear which files went
where.

You know you should never tell me that ;-)  How are you renaming them? 
Is this to standardize the extensions?  Here's my food for thought on
the directory problem - these are just ideas, so feel free to tear them
up, ignore them, whatever...

  Scrap the share1, share2, etc. system and instead have three
directories - systemextensions, externalpackages, and nonworking. 
System extensions would be things like the vect package, which are not
loaded by default but are considered part of the "main" system and we
expect to maintain ourselves.  externalpackages would be for things we
aren't maintaining as part of the core maxima effort, but feel are
worth including by default.  This will probably have more topic
specific packages.  (For example, if Feyncalc, a high energy
Mathematica package, were ported over to maxima, it could go in there. 
Few would have use for it, but it would IMHO be a worthwhile
inclusion.)  Hopefully as time goes by we will get more of this type of
thing.  It'll probably be a bit of a judgement call in some cases as to
where things should go, but at least it would make a little more sense.
 Nonworking could hold things like the other vect package, which
apparently isn't working too well right now but we don't want to get
rid of - basically for unmaintained stuff which isn't stable or usable.
 That'll mean we have to sort through that mess, but I suspect we have
to do that no matter what.

As for documentation, move everything into a top level directory called
doc, and from there have directories for referencemanual, usermanual,
and whatever else we feel we should include.

We might want to establish a couple standards, such as any module
accepted into systemextensions must be documented in the reference
manual, and figure out some general standard for external packages.  

Unfortunately, the documentation for 5.9 won't be much beyond where it
is right now - I haven't had time to put in writing more stuff, and
although Paulo has done some excellent work, we are still a LONG way
from a complete manual.  If you like, once we get some technical stuff
straightened out with the TeX, we can take what we've got and include
it with the 5.9 release.  

The good news is, Jay has done incredible work with the emaxima mode
and it's almost ready for prime time.  He's been incorporating features
form imaxima and batlatex, with niiicce results.  Once the bugs are
ironed out I'll announce a standard way to insert examples in the
manual, using emaxima.  For those with a postscript viewer, you can get
a preview of what's to come here:
http://maxima.sourceforge.net/basicschapteremacs.ps (This most likely
won't be the final look, but it is the idea.)  Most of it uses TeX -
there is also one ascii example, so those of you who are looking for an
ascii manual can get an idea, too.  It should be simple to produce all
TeX or all ascii manuals, so everyone (hopefully) will be happy.

Hi,

I've just passed my qualifying exam and now I have some time to rebuild 
Maxima using the latest snapshot...

The first time I did it, Mac OS X didn't have a Tcl/Tk native 
implementation and I used clisp 2.25.1 for the task.
Now I have clisp 2.27, a Tcl/Tk implementation and also gnuplot 3.7.1 at 
my disposal.

I wish you could please point me to documentation about the whole 
process, what are the necessary dependencies and what requirements I 
need in order to get a full working package. (Also, I want to use 
gnuplot in order to make graphs.)

I really appreciate,
Lizardo.

Try gcl-2.3.8beta3 with gcc 2.95 it must be OK.

forgive me if I have repeated myself (again)...I can't find record 
on my machine for having transmitted a response to this question....

1.  I believe I've had the same "apparent" problem with "make" in the
    GCL 2.4 build.  "make" isn't the source of the problem;
    "configure" fails but unless you read the transcript carefully (or
    you know what to expect) you'll miss it.  "configure" can be fixed
    on a case basis by editting the 'EMACS_*" variables with the
    actual path applicable to your system.

2.  2nd, although this will build gcl 2.4, the subsequent maxima build
    will NOT pass "make test".  So if the effort in compiling GCL is
    to build maxima, don't bother.  Building it w/ CLISP seems to be
    the easiest.

Subject: [Maxima] serious xmaxima problem with xfwm
Message-ID: <20011206095726.1ba6cc88.mramos@montevideo.com.uy>

Hi to all:

 I have a the following problem with xmaxima: 

 The problem is that I can't use the menus. When a menu pops up I can  select
 an element and click on it but nothing happens. When I click one element the
 menu closes, in the other window managers if I click and keep the mouse pointer
 over the menu it doesn't close. Other strange thing: when I open a menu, it
 overlap with the interactive window of maxima. If I click an element of the
 menu the interative window prompt appears where I clicked!!! That is, the click
 didn't affect the  menu, but affected the interactive window that is behind the
menu.

 Well, I have tested xmaxima with kde, gnome, twm, etc and the problem appears
 only
 with xfwm.

 I'll appreciate ideas or hints. I need xmaxima to work and need to get rid of
 this problem. I don't want to migrate to another wm.

 The following is one comment I received in the xfce mailing list:

#########
 I've just had a look at the source code for xmaxima, and it seems to build
menus
 from scratch, rather than using the usual Tk menu widgets. Now, it may have
very
 good reasons for doing things that way (e.g. it may have been originally
written
 several years ago under a very old version of Tk that didn't support menu bars,
or
 around the time Tk 8.0 introduced a new menu bar mechanism, but xmaxima still
 needed to run on old versions of Tk); but obviously, the more unusual the code,
the
 less likely it is to work.....
########

Is someone in this list using xmaxima with xfce? Has the same problems? 

 TIA

 Regards,
 	Marcelo.

Subject: [Maxima] Small update to makefile for CMUCL
Message-ID: <4nn10w19po.fsf@rtp.ericsson.se>

The makefile for maxima pre59 says:

cmulisp-compile:
	echo '(progn (load "compile-cmulisp.lisp")(compile-maxima))' | ${CMULISP}

I think we should either

o add (quit) to the end of the progn
o add the -batch flag after ${CMULISP}

The former will work on all versions of CMUCL.

Without one of these, we are left at the prompt, which is probably not
what we want.

But I'd rather have the defsystem version instead.

Hi,

the subject-line says it: Ihave some problems with xmaxima. When I start 
it, the prog always complains "Starting maxima timed out. Wait longer?" 
and, since maxima doesn't run, the examples won't run...

The other problem is: clicking on exit terminates not only the xmaxima 
process - it kills the whole session..

Any suggestions?

I encountered this problem when I first tried

Instead of making the output of maxima run through
tex, why don't we change the output of the Maxima display
program to be whatever information is actually needed
to display.  I don't know if this is some kind of
unicode or postscript or some other format, but the
program that displays
        2
       x

can certainly learn to use different size fonts and
spaces.  Since the maxima program also presumable has
some environmental access it can tell how wide your display
is and such stuff.

Can someone tell me what is needed by emacs21?  Although
looking at http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.21.1
I see that MS windows "does not yet implement various of the new
display features..."
which means to me, unfortnately, that anything that
depends on emacs21.1 display will not work on the most significant
part of the user community.

First, high-quality typesetting of formulae is not a trivial problem. Just
have a look at the sizes of programs that can do it well: TeX, lout,
TeXmacs. Your suggestion amounts to reimplementing one of them in Lisp. No
doudt, this is possible. The above examples show that this would require
many man-years of work.
Second, what OS API do you propose to use? Direct use of Win32 API is
tedious, and it would mean that all this work will be useless on all
platforms but one. You mentioned PostScript. It was indeed used for
display in NeXTStep, and can be used now in GNUStep with Display
GhostScript. Not too wide choice. Use X protocole? X fonts are not
particularly well suited for mathematics (this is the reason why LyX has
not so good display quality as TeXmacs).

I'd say that it is much better not to re-invent too many wheels, and to
use high-quality free software available. It seems to me that running TeX
on each Maxima output is a bit heavy-weight (though the results should be
good). I think that TeXmacs is a better solution. Have you used it? When
TeXmacs-Maxima interface works, it produces very high-quality results. I
think, we should stabilize this interface, maybe, merging it with Emaxima.
They should have, I suppose, very much code in common.

Best wishes,
Andrey

I agree TeXmacs is good in output and typing.
IMHO the problem is to save the session's input 
for a next time. In Emaxima it is easy. Is it planned to do the same in TeXmacs?

All the best,

This is already done. Just save the buffer you use into a file. Next time,
you can load this file, and re-run the session. This requires a recent
version of TeXmacs.

While on the subject of display, is it possible to set a variable that
will configure Maxima always to present its output in the same linear
format that is used for input?

This would be very helpful, especially to users of "linear" output
devices such as speech synthesizers and braille displays. I suspect it
would also make the output easier to process for GUI front-ends and
other such tools.

Thank you again. I tried it in TeXmacs-0.3.5.8 and it works.

Well, it should, probably, compile with Cygnus, and run with XFree86 for
Windows or some commercial X implementation (like Exceed). I know this is
heavy-weight; better use Linux :-)

I know a few problems more :-)

I think it would be good to restructure Maxima input-output a little to
make it more systematic. It would be ideal if all output would be produced
only via 2 functions, DISPLA and PROMPT. Lisp gurus, is this possible?

Hi,

Internet connection is an issue for me. I'm not used to CVS, but it 
seems that I have to download all the files and they aren't compressed. 
Is that right? Also, I really don't have the time to deal with the 
documentation in order to set a CVS account and download the sources.

So, could somebody please create a tar ball of Maxima pre59 and send me 
via e-mail?

I'd REALLY appreciate,
Lizardo.

Two possibilities which address these points - 

Variable: DISPLAY2D 
default: [TRUE] - if set to FALSE will cause the standard display to be
a string (1-dimensional) form rather than a display (2-dimensional)
form. This may be of benefit for users on printing consoles who would
like to conserve paper. 


Variable: DISPLAY_FORMAT_INTERNAL 
default: [FALSE] - if set to TRUE will cause expressions to be
displayed without being transformed in ways that hide the internal
mathematical representation. The display then corresponds to what the
INPART command returns rather than the PART command. Examples: 
User     PART       INPART
a-b;      A - B     A + (- 1) B
           A            - 1
a/b;       -         A B
           B
                       1/2
sqrt(x);   SQRT(X)    X
          4 X        4
X*4/3;    --        - X
           3         3

I guess I might as well add my current thoughts on this matter to this
thread, but keep in mind what I have in mind is a long term project,
which would hopefully produce excellent results but take some time and
effort.  

The problem of displaying Mathematical markup on multiple platforms has
never been fully addressed by any free library I am aware of.  The
closest one, which I beleve is the one most worth expanding and/or
basing our own solution on, is GtkMathView.  I have had communications
with the author indicating the code is not deeply tied to the GTK
toolkit, and just within the past few days someone has gotten it to
compile on Windows, so at least in theory it should be portable. 
Everyone I have heard discuss the code, even the founder of Gnome who
is usually highly critical of C++ code, says it is very well done.  Its
display, while perhaps not of the quality of TeX, is certainly high. 
It also has the ability to export to postscript.  Currently it is
mathml based, but if we were to add the ability to understand maxima's
representation of mathematics, the possibilities would begin to open
up.

My prefered general solution would involve two other major pieces -
wxWindows replacing Tcl/Tk, and a new plotting solution (particularly
3D) based on the Visualization Toolkit.  Both of these libraries are
robust and powerful, and there has already been a little work done on
getting these libraries to communicate.  The problems, however, are
nontrivial.  The plotting logic in maxima would need to be adapted to
VTK, and new VTK routines would have to be defined for plotting. 
GtkMathView would have to be adapted to work with wxWindows, to handle
maxima syntax, and hopefully ultimately to support formatted input as
well as handling the output.  The internal structure of maxima would
have to be restructured, with an eye towards communicating with
external interfaces.  (The last probably will have to be done anyway,
no matter what solution we decide on.)  Foreign function interfaces
would most likely have to be developed, although it is my hope that the
need for them could be kept to a minimum.  Once all this was
accomplished, however, we would have a general and extremely powerful
solution, with many of the major libraries being independantly
maintained.

Since the original discussion Richard and I had about my perl ideas,
I've come to the conclusion he was right about the approach I was
advocating at that time.  A much more robust solution is needed than
just copying and pasting files to the hard disk and having them read by
different programs.  I've been hunting good tools for the task, and the
above is the best long term solution I've been able to dream up.  The
capabilities of wxWindows would give us enormous flexability, and
native appearances on each platform.  VTK's graphics are unbelieveable,
and properly used should allow a 3D plotting solution beyond anything
else out there.  GtkMathView has done much hard work on the problem of
displaying math, in a manner which can apparently be made cross
platform with some work.

Since this discussion came up, I've gone ahead and voiced these
thoughts, even though I have not done the necessary work to actually be
able to say, definitely, that this can be done.  I invite comment by
more knowledgeable people (that's everyone ;-) as to this plan and
whether it has long term merit.  

This is also not to suggest that we abandon other efforts to try this -
the emacs interface has advantages which cannot be duplicated anywhere
else, and the ability of TeXmacs to interface with many systems alone
makes that effort worth persuing.  This is suggested as a long term
replacement for xmaxima more than anything.

The only problem I have with VTK is that it is HUGE! It seems crazy to 
add that much bulk to maxima. Also, it is not that trivial to compile
on different platforms. Current plotting (I think zplot for 3d) seems
ok to me. 
I use VTK for other visualization tasks. Very nice, but
not easy to install. Current maxima takes about 33MB with three
different lisp fasls and  dump files. VTK at least 300 MBs.
Too many dependencies will make maxima less attractive to install/use.

Ray said he would make a tarball. (Thanks, Ray.) HOWEVER, it's really
much easier than you think to get the source from cvs:

I know CVS has a learning curve. You don't need need to learn much to
check out the files, though.

You have to do that with a tarball, right? The thing is, once you've
checked out the cvs module, you can get incremental updates without
downloading any extra files.

No! Compression is a standard feature of cvs. The level of compression
is set by the -z option in the commands given later on.

You only need to set up an account if you want to put files in the cvs
repository. (In addition, you have to contact me to get write access.)

To check out the module anonymously, type:

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous at cvs.Maxima.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/maxima
login

When prompted for a password, just hit enter. cvs login stores the login
information in the file ~/.cvspass, so you only need to do this
operation one time. Now, to check out the module, type

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous at cvs.Maxima.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/maxima
co maxima-pre59

As I said, the -z option sets the compression level. Change the option
to -z9 if you want the maximum amount of compression.

This information is available on the web:
<http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4933>.

If you want to get updates to the module later on, make sure you are
inside the module directory, then type

cvs -z3 update -d

That's really all you need to know about cvs. It's easier than tarballs.
Really.

Hello *,


Instead of making the output of maxima run through
tex, why don't we change the output of the Maxima display
program to be whatever information is actually needed
to display.  I don't know if this is some kind of
unicode or postscript or some other format, but the
program that displays
        2
       x

can certainly learn to use different size fonts and
spaces.  Since the maxima program also presumable has
some environmental access it can tell how wide your display
is and such stuff.

First, high-quality typesetting of formulae is not a trivial problem. Just
have a look at the sizes of programs that can do it well: TeX, lout,
TeXmacs. Your suggestion amounts to reimplementing one of them in Lisp. No
doudt, this is possible. The above examples show that this would require
many man-years of work.

RJF:
No no... I have never heard of lout, but the size of those programs
may not be a good indication of the complexity of math typesetting 
because they must also include all of the support functions.  TeX for 
example has to do storage management, parsing, etc.  So it is the size 
of (a part of) Lisp + typesetting.  Maxima already has Lisp.  Besides 
which, TeX  (I don't know about the others) doesn't solve the problem of 
expressions that are too long. I have heard about but not tried a latex 
macro package that supposedly does this, but frankly I would be 
surprised if it works.  Maxima used to (probably still does) change
a+b+c
-----
d+e+f ....

to
(a+b+c)/(d+e+f)..
as the numerator and denominator grow.  Is the Latex macro clever enough 
for this?
(maybe.. I don't know).

The Maxima program already exists in large measure.  To change it to use
variable size fonts should not be a big change.  The technique for
summing up the width and height of subexpressions needs to be changed
to account for font characteristics.  Also, the second pass that
outputs stuff needs to change.  I think the subtleties of Knuth's glue 
algorithm might be added, but that seems to me to be optional.


Second, what OS API do you propose to use? Direct use of Win32 API is
tedious, and it would mean that all this work will be useless on all
platforms but one. You mentioned PostScript. It was indeed used for
display in NeXTStep, and can be used now in GNUStep with Display
GhostScript. Not too wide choice. Use X protocole? X fonts are not
particularly well suited for mathematics (this is the reason why LyX has
not so good display quality as TeXmacs).

RJF:
This is a really my question too.  What if emacs21 worked on windows
with display fonts?  Would that solve the problem in a portable way?
I think that if Win32 stuff were used, that would be nice for windows
users, and what would be needed is a linux (etc) simulation.  I find
the use of X window simulation on Windows (via Hummingbird) to be
a barely-acceptable alternative, but I don't know if that is free or
good enough.




I'd say that it is much better not to re-invent too many wheels, and to
use high-quality free software available. It seems to me that running TeX
on each Maxima output is a bit heavy-weight (though the results should be
good). I think that TeXmacs is a better solution. Have you used it? When
TeXmacs-Maxima interface works, it produces very high-quality results. I
think, we should stabilize this interface, maybe, merging it with Emaxima.
They should have, I suppose, very much code in common.

RJF:

I think these are two highly different programs.
(Also, Texmacs is quite complex, and not on windows. emacs21 also
is not fully functional on windows.)

No no... I have never heard of lout, but the size of those programs
may not be a good indication of the complexity of math typesetting 
because they must also include all of the support functions.  TeX for 
example has to do storage management, parsing, etc.  So it is the size 
of (a part of) Lisp + typesetting.  Maxima already has Lisp.  Besides 
which, TeX  (I don't know about the others) doesn't solve the problem of 
expressions that are too long. I have heard about but not tried a latex 
macro package that supposedly does this, but frankly I would be 
surprised if it works.  Maxima used to (probably still does) change
a+b+c
-----
d+e+f ....

to
(a+b+c)/(d+e+f)..
as the numerator and denominator grow.  Is the Latex macro clever enough 
for this?
(maybe.. I don't know).

The Maxima program already exists in large measure.  To change it to use
variable size fonts should not be a big change.  The technique for
summing up the width and height of subexpressions needs to be changed
to account for font characteristics.  Also, the second pass that
outputs stuff needs to change.  I think the subtleties of Knuth's glue 
algorithm might be added, but that seems to me to be optional.

This is a really my question too.  What if emacs21 worked on windows
with display fonts?  Would that solve the problem in a portable way?
I think that if Win32 stuff were used, that would be nice for windows
users, and what would be needed is a linux (etc) simulation.  I find
the use of X window simulation on Windows (via Hummingbird) to be
a barely-acceptable alternative, but I don't know if that is free or
good enough.

Using GtkMathView sounds like a good idea.  
Was getting it to compile on Windows a tricky affair, do you know?

Also, instead of getting GtkMathView to understand Maxima's output,
wouldn't it make more sense to give Maxima the ability to output in
MathML? GtkMathView would then be able to deal with the Maxima output,
and since MathML has aspirations of becoming the lingua franca of
computer math applications, I would expect this would become useful in
other areas besides display.

On a slightly different note, MuPAD has an output filter capability;
the command
Pref::output(fn)
will result in all subsequent output being replaced by fn(output).
I would think that something like this in Maxima would make it easier
for different frontends to get the output in a useful form.

A valid point, but are you sure it's 300MB??  My understanding was that
they recommend that RAM+SWAP be 300MB for compile - once you've got it
compiled, the binary is fairly reasonable.  If we put an rpm/deb
togeather, that should work for most people in Linux, and in windows we
can just include what we need in the install package.  I think our
current plotting is tied up with Tk somehow, and has (at least on my
machines) never felt really smooth or solid.  Also, with VTK once we
get the basics worked out it should be possible to extend the plotting
capabilities in virtually any way we want, if the examples I've see are
any indication. 

I suppose another option would be to look at IZIC, which is rather old
but has maxima bindings, which might give a head start.  It is also
relatively small, but I have no idea how portable or clean the code is.
 It hansn't been maintined since the early/mid ninties.

Maybe I'm selling our current routines short, but I can't help thinking
there's room for improvement.

I have a copy.  I like it.

I don't know how Mathematica and Maple handle it, but MuPAD has a
different strategy than Maxima for dealing with insufficient
information; while Maxima will ask the user, MuPAD will consider all
possibilities and return a piecewise defined function.
I have no idea which is better.

Other than that, really, I can't say much in comparing it to other
CASs.  I have little or no experience with CASs other than Maxima and
MuPAD. (I worked briefly on Mathematica, an experience from which I am
still trying to recover, and not at all with Maple, although I have
read enough about it to recognize the similarities between MuPAD and
Maple.  I had always assumed the similarities were there to make it
easy for users to migrate.)

There is a great deal to discuss about the future for interfaces for

I've been working on to provide a better user interface to Maxima. I'd
really rather focus on the basic text-mode of Maxima until at 6.0...

That said, I am interested in VTK. I'into the current mess I'm in is a

One solution to the lengthy expression problem is:

(d1) 1/x^10000 + ... + many more terms you'd be crazy to want to display

By "many more terms you'd be crazy to want to display,"  I literally
mean that string. Maxima's reveal can help out here.

Flip through a current J. Math. Phys or Physical Review -- how many
expressions are displayed that fill more than one line?  Long
expressions are almost never good for numerical computations and
rarely convey much information.

I've been stung too many times with many screen fulls of worthless junk

I completely agree.  We have to have a stable, documented platform
before we can try any fancy interface stuff.  I just thought I might as
well put out those suggestions, so people could take a look and see
what they think.

I don't know of any, except maybe this: 
http://mayavi.sourceforge.net/screenshots/2d_cont.gif  My thought was
if VTK can't handle 2D well enough, we could use something else such as
plplot or gnuplot for 2D, and only bring in VTK for the 3D stuff. The
commands are different, so keeping things straight in a coding sense
shouldn't be too hard (famous last words...)

Looking at GtkMathView is helpful.  I think that for
one direction (output), Maxima could produce MathML and have
it rendered by GtkMathView. I am not convinced that MathML
or its rendering by GtkMathView is sufficiently general to
do everything Maxima might produce, but I have no
counterexamples. The alternative that Jay suggests,
that GtkMathView could learn about Maxima, is tempting.
But this does not address
the extension possibility that one might want to SELECT
from the display and get the underlying Maxima code.  It also
seems that GtkMathView along with some other
proposals including TeXmacs, Emaxima
depends on linux, at least for the moment.
It would also be nice to be using a solid version of
whatever program is proposed...

There is a deeper problem, potentially.  That is, one
might introduce to Maxima a new form, say from a particular
application.  This can be done by syntax extension, and the
maxima display program understands this and does a suitable
display.
   I am not sure how flexible the MathML renderer will be
in such a situation, or if we want to put that too in
GtkMathView.  It might be OK, but I'm not sure. Or would it
be simpler to put GtkMathView into Lisp (or call it from
Lisp as a renderer).



The advantages of the "in house" Maxima display program
continue to be:
   a rather deep understanding of the relationship between
the display and the math, re-rendering subexpressions to
different forms as specified by space constraints and flags
(e.g.  exp(x) or e^x?  1/exp(x) or  exp(-x)    etc).

Also the possibility of retaining its format "map" so that
a selection can be made of a subexpression by pointing to
its image.

The main disadvantage seems to be that there is no uniform way of
printing a particular glyph on a particular spot on the user's
display.
(Other disadvantage: someone has to fix up the program in
Maxima to reference font information, and probably other things.)

Re: turning the system inside out...

what I mean by this is having every version of maxima start
as the maxima top-level read-eval-print loop  and hanging fancy display
off this.  That is,
read-eval-print    becomes  read-eval-fancydisplay loop.

What we have been discussing is

entirely-new-read
   send message to maxima
   receive message from maxima
entirely-new-display

loop.

This works, but it puts the control in the front end.

In fact there are many front ends possible, including one that looks
like this (emaxima). I gather it works like this:

Construct a whole document which occasionally includes math,
implemented by
creating a "cell" which includes a maxima-eval-maybe-typeset command.

Send the cell to maxima to evaluate.

So the model here is one of primacy of a document.
The model in Texmacs is, I think, similar, though there is this
  underlying  "almost Latex" encoding.
The model in Xmaxima  (Schelter's Tcl) is primacy of extended html
  (in one window) and a typewriter script (in the other).

Part of the decision as to what to do is a decision
between models.
My favorite model is script-in-ascii-window  (maxima.el mode),
but then I don't make much use of 3-d plots.

When Maxima outputs something in TeX form, I assume it doesn't use any
of TeX's programming capabilities, but rather TeX is used as a markup
language.  I had guessed (perhaps wrongly) that if Maxima could
provide the output in TeX, it could provide it in MathML.
Or are there possibly situations where the TeX output get messed up?

As much as I'd like to take credit for good, or even tempting, ideas,
this was suggested by CY.

How does tex(...) handle that?

This is (I think) what Jesper Harder used in imaxima to display the
Maxima output in already TeXed (rather than ready to be TeXed) form.

Yes, indeed. I used texmacs.lisp (with some small modifications) in an
Emacs mode [1] for displaying Maxima output as images typeset by TeX.

I think I've managed to work around the prompt issues you mention above,
though I agree that it would be nice if the Maxima output was more
structured.

No, it isn't that clever. In general, the package deals quite well with
breaking at binary relations, like + and -, but doesn't know how to deal
with very wide fractions, superscripts, subscripts etc. I think the same
applies to TeXmacs.

Well, Yahoo is apparently slow on the uptake, so I'll try to do it this
way...

I gather, from what I saw on the list, that someone had made the
attempt, was successful, and was sending the needed changes back to the
developer, who then discussed some of them to figure out the best
overall solution, and was going to incorporate them as soon as it was
all figured out.  So right now it would be tough, but hopefully by the
point we start messing with it, most of the ground work for cross
platform stuff will be there.  wxWindows bindings for the math stuff,
however, we would probably have to handle, as well as adding input
capabilities.  Input could be tricky (it's currently geared for
output), wxWindows probably somewhat less so.  Either way, a heck of a
lot better than starting from scratch.

I'm not sure about that, although there may be several advantages. 
Certainly I can see advantages for webpage work - an extension to
Emaxima might allow fairly impressive online math work to be 
done quickly.

Quite possibly - my idea there was to have an "environment variable"
that would be set as the program started up, but that approach would be
limiting if different interfaces wanted to communicate with the same
maxima process.  So such a command may be the better way.  (I have no
idea if access from multiple interfaces would be desirable, but just in
case...  Can anyone think of a situation where that would be
desirable?)

I guess it depends on how general we want to make this - if
I had to guess, I'd say 80% of the benefit of typesetting 
mathematics is in actual greek characters, real integral 
signs, sums and square roots, and fractions and matricies that
are actually how they look in the math book.  I think that
MathML can handle that kind of stuff - if Maxima does produce
something that the display widget doesn't know how to format,
it can just output the usual ascii formatting, and if it looks
like it is something that can/should be formatted, we can add
it to wherever we decide to put those rules.  Which raises an
important point - whatever rules we impliment, for whatever 
solution, should be cleanly and easily extendable.

I think we might be able to handle that, with some extensions to 
the code.  If everything being displayed is at some level
translated to maxima code (which it has to be, somewhere) then we
can have a function selectiontomaxima(selected) which would run
the conversion and return the maxima code used.  The only problem
I can immediately forsee is if there is something that changes
form in different contexts, and even then there may be ways around
that.  If we generate the MathML in maxima itself, that might
offer some advantages in the way of environment awareness, but
that could get complicated and would probably have to be addressed
in a process of iteration.

TeXmacs is indeed Linux specific, barring some rather extraordinary
efforts to install support software on Windows.  GtkMathView however,
based on some recient emailings to the GthMathView mail list, can
function on Windows as well.  That's actually one of the things that
attracted me to it - the excellent prospects for use with different
toolkits and platforms.

I agree a solid version would be nice.  I think by the time we are in
shape with the regular code base to take a crack at this, probably the
current shift GtkMathView is undergoing will have been largely achieved
and will be worth working with.

Could you give an example of how this would work?  I'm not
quite sure what you mean by a syntax extension.

Flags could be handled, I think - the problem would be space
constraints.  How crutial is that, though?  For ordinary 
sessions that I'm used to, it doesn't make a huge difference.
Readibility is the key, not necessarily space - a scrolled 
display can go as long as it needs to.

We should be able to do this from an external interface as well -
I think symaxx has that ability already.  Or am I misunderstanding
what you mean by selection of a subexpression?

That's far beyond my capabilities for the forseeable future, and it's 
still not clear to me what we gain doing that that we can't get with
an external interface.  I know that's probably me not seeing something 
important, though.

In that case, these programs are not good solutions.  I suppose they 
could just say
"oops, too wide to display"  or  "here is the leftmost 8.5 inches of
your display, the rest is gone".

But that's not very nice.

I'm not sure if I know of ANY system that can do really well at that -
certainly in my experience Mathematica can not.  Also, would we
sometimes the long form, say on a window which can use a scrolled
display to fit it, and then break it up for printing, or would we want
it to always be broken up?  There may be cases were the expression
which is too large to print is the desired one for seeing a property
visually.  What could be done, anyway, even from a theory standpoint? 
Or, to pose the question more properly, what would the ideal behavior
of a proper package to handle the general problem of overly long lines?

There is no reason for X fonts not to look as good as TeX:  The
complete set of TeX CM fonts including math are available for free as
Type1 Postscript fonts.  Every recent Unix system I know of today
supports this, and I've done this via ghostscript where the PS file

do this anymore because then I can't print the files without sending
the fonts to the printer first, which I invariably forget to do.)

there is a facility that allows you to define

for example,

matchfix(BEGIN, END);
    /* at this point,  BEGIN m,n,p END   is a new input AND output form! */


BEGIN a,b,c END :=  a+b*c;

Well, the rest isn't really gone.  In TeXmacs you get a horizontal
scroll bar, which you can use to see the rest.  In Emacs you can use the
usual key binding, `C-x <', to scroll the buffer horizontally.

But I get your point: if Maxima does the typesetting then it's able to
make some more intelligent decisions that an external renderer could
probably never do.

One thing - Richard, I recall you wrote that Wolfram was initially a
little distrubed by your mma parser, but then they sort of lost
interest.  If any of the commerical folks should think we are looking
too similar to them in whatever we wind up doing, will they get upset
again?  I don't know why they would given the basic similarity of
pretty much every interface I've seen, but I figured I should at least
pose the question.

It's definitely a fine line, but once we know the sticky points I think
we will be able to figure out something that works.

Anyone can sue anyone else.  I agree that the similarity of

I agree that GtkMathView is an interesting piece of free software. In many
ways, GtkMathView interface to Maxima will be similar to TeXmacs
interface, with LaTeX replaced by MathML. Personally, I am not a great fan
of MathML: it is more complicated and more verbose than LaTeX, and I don't
see significant advantages. But its expressive power is not worse than
that of LaTeX, surely. It would be easy to write MathML generation in
Maxima, similarly to the current TeX generation functions - a few hundreds
lines of code, I guess.

I don't quite understand why you want to replace gtk by wxWindows. gtk is
a nice cross-platform GUI library. Writing a GUI with it is rather simple,
the library is light enough, and compiles even on Windows, as I heard. Why
not write a GUI in gtk, with GtkMathView as its main widget? Also, there
is gtk-extra, which contains additional widgets for plotting. This library
was used in SciGraphica - a free program for production of
publication-quality plots (similar to Origin). Why not use it instead of
VTK? It's small, and some code from SciGraphica can be re-used.

I don't use xfce on regular basis but I have it installed

fine on it. But I remember that I had similar problems
with xmaxima menus on KDE with earlier versions
of xmaxima. Latest version from CVS is much better.

I can&nbsp; select
<br>&nbsp;an element and click on it but nothing happens. When I click
one element the
<br>&nbsp;menu closes, in the other window managers if I click and keep
the mouse pointer
<br>&nbsp;over the menu it doesn't close. Other strange thing: when I open
a menu, it
<br>&nbsp;overlap with the interactive window of maxima. If I click an
element of the
<br>&nbsp;menu the interative window prompt appears where I clicked!!!
That is, the click
<br>&nbsp;didn't affect the&nbsp; menu, but affected the interactive window
that is behind the
<br>menu.
<p>&nbsp;Well, I have tested xmaxima with kde, gnome, twm, etc and the
problem appears
<br>&nbsp;only
<br>&nbsp;with xfwm.
<p>&nbsp;I'll appreciate ideas or hints. I need xmaxima to work and need
to get rid of
<br>&nbsp;this problem. I don't want to migrate to another wm.
<p>&nbsp;The following is one comment I received in the xfce mailing list:
<p>#########
<br>&nbsp;I've just had a look at the source code for xmaxima, and it seems
to build
<br>menus
<br>&nbsp;from scratch, rather than using the usual Tk menu widgets. Now,
it may have
<br>very
<br>&nbsp;good reasons for doing things that way (e.g. it may have been
originally
<br>written
<br>&nbsp;several years ago under a very old version of Tk that didn't
support menu bars,
<br>or
<br>&nbsp;around the time Tk 8.0 introduced a new menu bar mechanism, but
xmaxima still
<br>&nbsp;needed to run on old versions of Tk); but obviously, the more
unusual the code,
<br>the
<br>&nbsp;less likely it is to work.....
<br>########
<p>Is someone in this list using xmaxima with xfce? Has the same problems?
<p>&nbsp;TIA

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcelo.

<br><a href="http://www.math.utexas.edu/mailman/listinfo/maxima"></a>&nbsp;</blockquote>
I don't use xfce on regular basis but I have it installed
<br>on Linux machine. I've just checked - xmaxima works
<br>fine on it. But I remember that I had similar problems
<br>with xmaxima menus on KDE with earlier versions

I tried to build gcl on NT and failed.

I tried to build maxima with the win32 binary of clisp-2.27, but clisp went
into an infinite loop during the compilation process.  I haven't followed up
in this.

I have build clisp-2.27 and then maxima-pre5.9 on NT using cygwin.  See:

http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2001/000871.html

Note that the patch to maxima in not required now.

Faced with the threat of getting a 52-piece shar archive, you

Don't worry, you'd want to use the emacs interface instead...

Put mgnuplot somewhere in you path and try:

Hello!

I had reported about some bugs in "itensor.lisp" ones. 
Well, the bad news is that, yet, there are more problems than with "components(tensor,comps)".
 The good one that almost all of them can be overcome by
somehow. So itensor is quit possible to use. 
The list of things, in which I found some problems in trying to reproduce
 the results given in "tensor.doc" is following, 
components(tensor,comps) does not work, covdiff(exp,v1,v2....) give diagnostic 
like"unbound variable D", rename(exp) give report like "variable INDEX is unbound", 
the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor is not changed after changing 
the metric, after the first call of "show(exp)" the next call does not work.
 Still there are, may be, some more.

The idea to overcome components(tensor,comps) is in maxima/tensor/anew.txt, it is to use
pure maxima commands to define tensor components. The same
way can be used for the Riemann curvature tensor.

I tried to exclude the bugs with covdiff(exp,v1,v2....) and show(exp) 
now it works.

To simplify expression we can always use "canform(exp)" instead rename(exp).
E.g. example proving the symmetry property for  the Riemann curvature tensor in "tensor.doc"
can be done by "show(canform(exp))".

Finally after changing "itensor.lisp" in correspondence with "diff.itensor" ( in attachment)
and using idea about metric definition from "anew.txt",
I was able to reproduce every result from "tensor.doc".
I will try more tests from commercial macsyma which is availble here to me , by chance.

Lisp's expert, please, check the suggested changes in diff.tensor. I'm newbie in lisp

All the best, Valerij

Here are descriptions of new or updated Maxima code that can
downloaded from http://www.unk.edu/acad/math/people/willisb/

I suggest items 0 and 1 be placed in Maxima-5.9;  I welcome
suggestions for improvements and bug reports for items 2 and 3.

0.  specfun-110.tar.gz  --- I fixed some problems with the
gradef statements and the documentation.   The files specfun.mc
and specfun.texi in this archive should replace the files Maxima
currently uses.  If you like quantum mechanics, you may enjoy
the two demonstration programs.

1.  mactex-1.7.lisp --- I collected all the additions and fixes
I know of for mactex.  I suggest that mactex-1.7.lisp replace the
version that Maxima currently uses.

2. sets.lisp  -- a replacement to Maxima's set package. Maxima's
/share2/set.lisp code seems to be broken. Documentation is here

http://www.unk.edu/acad/math/people/willisb/sets.html

3.  powers.lisp  -- The power function is documented in Maxima,
but it is missing from version 5.6.   Call it a bug or call it a
feature,  my power function demands that expressions be expanded.
If you know how powers can be extracted faster without expanding,
let me know.

I don't know what powers does, but hipow should be
in the system, as well as coef and ratcoef .

  I don't know about expanding, but typically ratexpand is
much faster than expand, and there is probably no way
of computing ALL the powers without expansion.  If you
want only the highest power, it is possible to do so,
but in the worst case you would have to do as much work.
Proof.
    f(y)*x^10  + x^9.

The highest power of x is either 10 or 9, depending on
whether f(y) is 0 or not.  How can you tell? Expand f(y) etc.

Well, we might be able to teach GtkMathView to understand maxima, too -
it's a question which is the better solution.  As much as any of us
might dislike mathml, it will be the standard for web based mathematics
in the future.  Mozilla already has some basic support for it.  The
ability of maxima to export mathml has interesting possibilities when
it comes to an easy way to create web pages with maxima sessions in
them.

That is a possibility, but there are several problems with it.  First,
the Windows port of GTK is maintained by the same person who ported the
GIMP, and AFAIK is not part of the main GTK effort.  This means if this
individual should lose interest or have to quit working on it, we could
be out in the cold.  wxWindows has a large user and maintainer base,
and as a consequence is a more stable long term development target,
IMHO.  Second, GTK for Windows does not have the look of a native
Windows application.  This is a minor point, but in many cases the
overall user experience with a program, particularly on windows, can be
worsened by this.  wxWindows has the advantage of using the native look
of whatever platform it happens to be on.  On Linux, it can use GTK or
Motif, on Windows it looks like Windows.  Since the larger audience for
Maxima is currently Windows users, it might be worth it to take
advantage of wxWindow's feature set here.  To me it just seemed like an
overall cleaner solution in the long term.  It does involve more up
front work, and will mean a longer development time until the first
release, but if we can do it hopefully it will give us more breathing
room and options down the road.

If you want to play with GTK a bit, though, I have a glade file at
http://mathshield.sourceforge.net which you are more than welcome to
use, if it's of any interest.  I started it a while back, and haven't
had the time to do much with it lately.  The site says perl, but you
will be able to use Glade to generate code for C/C++ as well, if I
recall glade's feature set correctly.  The images files you need can be
pulled from CVS.

I'm familiar with Scigraphica, and I agree it looks attractive, but I'm
not sure if it has ever been compiled on Windows.  If we were writing
only for Linux I would say your solution is better - it's the cross
platform nature of the problem which sticks some monkey wrenches into
the gears.  The reason I suggested wxWindows and VTK is that they are
already known to work with both Linux and Windows, both are maintained
by teams of developers to be cross platform, both are very powerful and
will likely be flexible when we add features in the future, and
wxWindows I believe even works on MacOS, which at some point might be
of interest.  PowerLisp exists for MacOS, and is free for personal use
at least, although I don't know if anyone has ever tried compiling
Maxima on it yet, and if that is made to work then we might want to
think about the possibility of a three platform interface.

In a similar vein, I have updated my elliptic functions package to
support all 12 Jacobian elliptic functions and their inverses,

to make the names match Macsyma as best as I could without actually
having Macsyma (thanks to Richard Fatement and Barton Willis).

It's basically a major update of ellipt.lisp, which only knew how to
evaluate sn/cn/dn for numeric args.

The package consists of a new ellipt.lisp and a set of patches to
other routines so that tex can print out the standard notation for the
functions, limits can be taken, and converting some special values of
elliptic functions to expressions involving gamma functions.  There's
also some rudimentary documentation.  No test suite has been written.

I think it would be safe to incorporate since the original ellipt
package was broken (sn(x) would return some junk number, not SN(X)).

If there's interest, I can send it on.  It's a bit large, so I didn't
include it here.

Agreed, but we need to figure out how first.  There's been some good
work done on the command line side of things, but a) it involved
recompiling clisp, which we would most likely have to bundle with the
binary b) xmaxima, if I recall correctly, we have not been able to get
working on Windows, and c) we need to figure out how to set up the
install utility.
There will be more issues if we want to include the emacs mode.

Message-ID: <200112111934.MAA09964@mantis.privatei.com>

Did we lose the install stuff that created the windows binary on the
original maxima site?  I am running that currently.  Due to problems
running code, I decided to move to pre59, to that end I just built
clisp using cygwin, and was going to try to build maxima using it.
I was unable to get the cvs gcl built under nt, due to failures in
the fasl routine.  Is the main issue with clisp tk bindings?
I did notice tk bindings for clisp on the clisp.cons.org site.

Once we iron out the Windows problems, I'd like to suggest we use
InnoSetup to make the install wizard, rather than Mailman or whatever
the old one is called.  The website for InnoSetup is here:
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.htm, it's free, it's open source, and
it looks like the newer Windows installers.  Does anyone have any
experience with any other installers they prefer?

I don't quite understand you. The current Maxima output format is not
formalized enough to be an alternative to LaTeX or MathML. If you want to
formalize it and to create a new math typesetting language in addition to
LaTeX and MathML, I am against such a thing. It's better to use MathML. I
can try to write MathML generation in Maxima patterned after LaTeX
generation. It would be useful anyway.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that wxWindows is used in
several free software projects, and gtk - in several thousand projects.
This means it will never die. And I don't like too high towers - wxWindows
on top of gtk on top of Xlib.

You can also consider another option (though I don't like it for the same
reason - too high tower). Qt is supported by TrollTech on both Posix
platforms and Windows. It can now directly include gtk widgets, in
particular, I suppose, GtkMathView. It is GPLed (NOT LGPL!).

Most of it is in Python, and need no compilation. We only have to compile
gtk-extra.

There are two issues here. I will address them separately:

1) Window binaries. I have to confess that I haven't even looked at how
to generate maxima binaries on windows. (Is the procedure even
documented? Does it require cygwin?) I definitely would like to have
windows binaries available, but we need a volunteer to produce them.

Any volunteers to produce the window binaries?

2) The release plans. The goal is to have a stable, well-documented
Maxima 6.0 that works with multiple lisp implementations. To that end,
we will have a series of development releases starting with 5.9.0. The
development series releases may not be stable enough for everyday use. I
hope that 6.0 will be distributed far and wide. I do not want to promote
the 5.9.x releases to new users, lest they be frightened away.

Best,
Jim

Subject: [Maxima] New files in cvs in preparation for 5.9.0
Message-ID: <1008170444.26171.13.camel@abacus>

There is a now a directory called for59 in the maxima-pre59 cvs module.
(Please note: if you have the maxima-pre59 module checked out already,
you will need to do a "cvs update -d" to get the new directory.) 

Please note that all of the files in for59 are considered works in
progress. Please see the file for59/TODO for a partial listing of
incomplete tasks.

Execute the script "migrate" in the for59 directory to automatically
populate the new maxima module. By default, migrate will call the new
directory "maxima" and put it next to the existing maxima-pre59
directory. To put the module somewhere else, give migrate the full path
name to a different directory as an argument. migrate will not overwrite
an existing directory.

Note: migrate is not finished. When it is finished, all the files in the
existing maxima-pre59 module will be in the new maxima module, possibly
renamed. We will not throw anything away. migrate also creates a script
migrate-back.sh, which will move the files back to the original names
and places in the maxima-pre59 module.

In the new maxima directory:

To try the new build system, execute the script "bootstrap", followed by
configure. You will have to give configure at least one of
(--enable-clisp, --enable-cmucl, --enable-gcl). Do a make followed by
make install. Invoke maxima with
	maxima --clisp
	maxima --cmucl
	maxima --gcl
as appropriate. (The maxima script itself is not nearly complete. Please
bear with me. See the TODO.) Maxima can be compiled and installed with
any/all of the given lisp implementations simultaneously. Multiple
subsequent versions of maxima will also be able to be installed
simultaneously.

Well, my thoughts are that unless someone is going to take over supporting

Anyone thought about just going entirely away from TK to like GTK+ for GUI
support?  GTK+ is available on many more platformst (at least from what I 
can see) than TK is.

Hi James - My understanding, from my experience with Cygwin, is that the
Windows Maxima binary (the one currently available from math.utexas.edu) was
constructed using the "mingw" version of Cygwin.  I haven't used mingw, but
from what I understand it is a minimal implementation of the system
including the complete (I hope) C compiler chain.  Some of this is in fact
installed the Maxima binary itself, as you will see if you poke around in
the subdirectories.  I don't see why one couldn't continue to use this
approach for generating Maxima binaries, but it would of course have to work
with all of the recent modifications and improvements.  Also, it is worth
mentioning that the Cygwin/mingw gcc compiler is a bit idiosyncratic in that
it doesn't exactly follow the corresponding thing in a Linux installation
(eg., header files).  This of course leads to the current problems producing
GCL and Maxima.  I expect as well that if you want to generate Maxima
complete with a graphical interface, you will also need a compatible and
consistent Xfree86.  Please forgive me if this all sounds a bit elementary,
but I do speak from experience...

I quite disagree.  In fact, the semantics or the syntactic appearance 
for typeset mathematics in MathML is, so far as I can tell,  not 
formally specified, and for LaTeX there is deliberately no semantics 
associated with the appearance so that $AB$  could be A*B  or matrix 
multiply AB or a symbol AB.   and $A^(4)$ could mean the 4th derivative. 
Or something else.   For Maxima, the meaning of any utterance is what it 
means to Maxima, which is operationally defined, and is entirely formal 
in the sense of computation. You might not like that computation, but it 
is formally expressed in the program.  MathML is expressed in some 
slipperly natural language. On top of that it is about 20 times more 
verbose.

I think that it may be politically the right thing to use MathML, and 
relatively easy to make MathML using the same style as the mactex.lisp 
program, but from a technical standpoint I think that MathML offers very 
little, at least if you are using it for Maxima <--> Maxima front end.
If you make Maxima front ends out of browsers, then there would be
a possible motive.

In the interests of not building towers, I would still prefer taking
whatever is written (say in Python!) and writing it it lisp so that
we have Maxima  (in lisp)  generating a picture-language that is
nothing more than a glyph/position collection  (and maybe even plotting, 
too?)  talking to a very simple and OS/machine independent display. 
Maybe even a postscript interpreter.

But all these other options may be interesting too... I can't say I've 
tried them!

I agree.  I just ment where to add the ability to go from maxima
internals
to formatted graphical input/output.  I

That would be great.

As far as open source goes, you are correct.  But keep in mind - most 
Linux products are not written as cross platform applicaitons.  Thus,
most projects have no need for wxWindow's benefits.  GTK itself
will never die, but the Windows port of it might.

As for too high towers, I'm not sure it's too high in this case - just
high
enough.  Aiming a little higher gets us (IMHO, of course) a lot ofl
benefits.  I don't think the performance hit would be major - wxWindows

seems to have done a decent job in that department.  I've installed an 
email client written with wxWindows, and that seemed to do OK on
both platforms.

That is indeed a possibility - I don't know enough about it's including
gtk 
widgets to comment.  That still leaves out the Macintosh, however.

That's the crux - I've never tried, and I've never heard of anyone
trying.
Are you able to take a shot at it?

Well, that's sort of a motive - that, and taking advantage of what has
already 
been done in the department of display libraries.  At some point maybe
we
can add the ability to MathView to handle TeX, which would probably sit
much better in many quarters, but the idea of easy display of Maxima
notebooks
on the web is not to be taken lightly - my personal opinion is that
such an 
ability will appeal to a lot of people.

I agree this is attractive, but it has several practical drawbacks,
not the least of which is we would have to maintain everything
ourselves.  Can you give us a rough idea of the problems we would
have to tackle and solve before this could become a practical 
solution?

Message-ID: <200112121738.KAA09775@mantis.privatei.com>

If someone can tell me which version of gcl was used to build the
current windows binary, I will install the mingw toolset and try to
build gcl.  If someone can supply the install scripts, then I will try
to build a install binary.  I have a nt system that doesnt have cygwin
on it.  BTW, I was able to build gcl 2.4 beta on linux and maxima-pre59
but I did not try to build it with tk or tcl support.  The only change
I made was to change the maxima makefile for my gcl directory.

GCL 2.3.6, but whether pre-59 will work with that version I have no
idea.  We might have to settle for clisp.

If they aren't in the CVS tree, I'm not sure if we have them.  In any
case, I think we should be able to use InnoSetup to make an install
script fairly easily - I took a shot at it last night, and was very
impressed with it.  That will handle most of it, and we can write or
find a batch file which will set the necessary variables and such.  You
might look in the deliver directory in CVS - I believe that's where at
least some of the old install stuff is.

I looked at the readme.xmaxima with the windows binary and it says
something about using freewrap for the tcl part. freewrap is located
here:  http://home.nycap.rr.com/dlabelle/freewrap/freewrap.html

If it is written in common lisp, then there is rather little
to maintain on that side.  The ability to do "display postscript"
might be machine/OS independent, but I don't know how this
would really work in practice.

My concern is that too much free software in this tower may in fact be 
"demoware".  That is, it works on selected cases (screenshots), and not 
much else can be said about it. This is true of some commercial software 
too, I guess. It can be really good or not, and is hard to tell because 
the other half of the software production cycle (testing, debugging, 
certifying, etc.) is usually not as exciting as the first half, namely 
design and implementation.

  Computer algebra system users tend to press on the
boundaries: what is the largest computation that can be done?
What is the largest expression that can be displayed? Thus
any front end must be very general, and of course very reliable.
Using someone else's MathML displayer may be a good idea,
but does this program know how to format EVERYTHING Maxima
can display? (Including Maxima language, maybe even lisp?)
Can it do line-breaks?  Can it feed back "the user is pointing
to subexpression "s+t""?

To move away from the display issue, consider another issue:
memory allocation.  I think that GCL has certain problems in
this regard, and I don't know about CLISP or the offspring of
CMU lisp.  If you run a problem and you find you have inadequate
stack to complete it, what do you have to do?  Here are
the possibilities:
  1. You have to recompile GCL and reload Maxima because the
only way to increase the stack is by recompiling Lisp.  1b. You
then start your problem again, perhaps from some checkpoint,
and hope you have enough stack.
  2. You have to reload GCL with a different run-time parameter.
Go to 1b.
  3. You do nothing because GCL has increased the stack automatically,
and has continued the computation.  The fact that you have run
out of stack means that your computer / virtual memory/ etc
just can't do it.  Rethink your algorithm, or make your problem
smaller.
  4. Even though there is lots of extra memory, your system was
configured by design to use only 16-bit addresses (or some such
limitation), and your system can't use it.  (A problem with
old Maple systems for example.).

One of the disadvantages of free open source software is that
because it is possible to solve problems by (1), the better
solutions of 2 or 3  are not addressed.  Even though we know
that recompiling GCL is not something everyone can do, the
fact that it is possible to do so means that some problems will
not be solved "professionally".  There are of course advantages
to free software, but it is a balance.

Anyway, I've digressed too much. If someone can tell me that there is a 
postscript displayer or a alternative way of spewing characters onto a 
screen -perhaps into emacs21 -- not just on linux but on windows -- that 
would be great.   (I'm willing to build the tower  emacs21+maxima since 
emacs has clearly gone beyond the demoware stage.  I just don't know 
enough about any of the other proposals, though I'm trying to learn 
more.)  Or maybe Gtkmath would be happy to display stuff?  I am
willing to write a program that takes  the internal form of Maxima
(a+b)/(c+d),  and change it to
display times-italic(a) at relative position 10,10
display times-roman (+) at ....
etc.
Though it would be really nice if someone had font metric tables in a 
database accessible from lisp.

I'm definitely interested.  Maybe you can upload it to CVS, so we can
check it out from there?

While I haven't yet tried it out, the commit logs for this sure look
good!

My only question is if configure should different executable names?  I
call my CMUCL binary/script as cmulisp.  I think the configure scripts
assume it's cmucl.  I think the default name is lisp.  Matlisp's
configure allows you to specify the executable name if you need to.

>From the commit logs, I think it's missing the definition of quit for
CMUCL.  The top-level loop is also quite different from what I'm
using, and I think the one there doesn't actually work.

When I get the code, I'll look at it and see how my current stuff
differs.

FWIW, I've never been able to build gcl 2.4 on my Linux box, but I
have 2.3.x and I did build maxima 5.6 with that.  It seemed to work
fine, but this was a while ago.

For CMUCL, you are out of luck if you run out of stack.  In fact, CMUCL

And if you really need a bigger stack, you have to convince the CMUCL
guys to do a hairy cross-compile to increase it.

However, I think there's 128 MB of stack space and 1 GB or more of
heap, which is probably enough for any kind of problem I would expect
to run and finish in my lifetime. :-)

Firstoff, thanks for undertaking this!

I guess my big thing, after compile problems, would be to flesh out and
incorporate the readline patches already submitted earlier - that would
be a big step forward for usability.

Yes. Stop the presses. I left out a crucial bit of information: it
doesn't work. Quit is missing from the CMUCL version. GCL doesn't work
at all. Other things are broken. I had meant to state that explicitly in
my first message. Sorry. I had those things working with the tarball I
produced in October. I just have to chase down which things didn't get
updated properly.

I really did mean to emphasize the "not finished" part.

Yes. There is an entry in the TODO file for that.

In a previous message to the list, I saw a bench mark that indicated

be better served by building the stuff in clisp that gcl has,
which I thought was tk support, and then putting our time into cmucl
and making it work on more platforms?  clisp is a gpl'd product also,
works on many more platforms than gcl.  Plus, it implements CLOS,

Only 30%?  I have maxima jobs that take 24 hrs to run on a very fast box.  30% is significant.

Making CMUCL run on more platforms is an extremely difficult task.  It
involves describing every instruction of the architecture, figuring
out the assembly calling conventions, how you want assign registers,
and writing a ton of assembly code and then you're still not done
because you have to use an existing version to cross-compile to the
new.

A very daunting task.

Gcl doesn't need any of those features for maxima.

I'll send the whole package with patches to you soon.

I don't really need or want access if someone is willing to apply
the changes. :-)

After the elliptic functions stuff, I don't really have much more to
contribute, except, perhaps, make maxima understand complex numbers a
little bit more so that asin(2.0) returns something more useful than
asin(2.0). :-)  The elliptic function package has support for that
now, so it's just a matter of making the other functions do similar
things.

Subject: [Maxima] why GCL,  what about Allegro
Message-ID: <3C17F3CC.3070001@cs.berkeley.edu>

I think that Schelter contributed some code
that runs only in GCL or is linked to GCL through
foreign function interface that makes some procedures
run far faster than expected. If you are not using
these procedures, the difference would not be visible.
I do not know where these are used but I suspect
polynomial factorization.

I have explored with Franz Inc the possibility of
their providing a base of Allegro CL for Maxima
development.

Advantage:  supported ANSI CL on Windows, Mac OS-X, many
different UNIX and linux systems, many extras like
graphics, web support, etc.  (see franz.com).

Disadvantage:  it does not come with source code.
Disadvantage:  there will be presumably SOME restriction
on this so that they are not giving away their main
source of revenue free.  Yet this may not be much of
a restriction since Franz already gives away a rather complete
lisp free (minus some compiler features and maybe a
maximum memory limit, plus.. one must re-register periodically...).
The free "student" version does not
include (I think) the full compiler (just compiles in-core,
not producing files), and I think does not support
new foreign function linkages.  I think that both
these restrictions would have to be lifted to be
viable.

My guess is that it will be something like

the free lisp + enough extra resources to include all
of maxima code + enough free space to continue to make it
interesting.

I don't know how people here feel about this.
Possible reactions

1. Yes, let's do it. It makes our lives simpler.
    (We still need to understand what restrictions we
     can live with.)

2. No, only open-source GPL code allowed here.

3. It's just another Lisp, along with GCL etc to support.
Do it if you want to.

4. Something else.


If you are inclined towards reaction 1, we still
need to make our list of "non-negotiable demands".
They must be such that Franz Inc's business is
placed in jeopardy.  If we use this code it is
in our best interests that the company remain profitable.

One of the reasons I started with maxima was the failure of Macsyma,
Inc. to support their code.
I would have to see what changes to the maxima code base would have to
be made to work
with Allegro, and if it would cause incompatibility with clisp or
cmucl.  Also, I am loath to
create a gui using some proprietary toolkit.  As far as I am concerned,
I dont care what kind of
lisp I use, I just dont like seeing emails complaining about the failure
of gcl to build.  However,
I am leaning toward steelbank, which is a offshoot of cmucl, as its goal
is maintainability.
I think whichever free lisp machine code compiler which gets to windows
first will
win, in the same way that gcc is the default enviornment for a lot of
people.

I quite disagree. Maxima language has a well-defined *mathematical*
semantics, but no *typesetting* semantics. LaTeX has a well-defined
typesetting semantics, and no mathematical semantics. MathML has
typesetting semantics, and a little bit of mathematical semantics.

If somebody would like to use Maxima as a typesetting language, it will
have to be enhanced by a lot of markup stuff. Why create a new LaTeX, when
LaTeX works so wonderfully?

The answer is: Display GhostScript. GhostScript is an excellent PostScript
interpreter; Display GhostScript incorporates Display enhancements, which
were designed by NeXT in order to make PostScript viable as a means of
communication between applications and display.

If anybody with a real Allegro license compiles maxima to produce a
Windows image, I'm sure somebody else with an interest in maxima on
that platform will download the free version from Franz and find out
what happens when he hits the 18 MB heap limit:-) Given that heap
limit and the 60-day license renewal, I wouldn't consider ACL Trial
Edition an attractive platform for maxima.


Has anybody tried to compile maxima with Corman Lisp -
<http://www.corman.net/>? The conditions on the free version seems
quite generous. IIUC, they would allow re-distributing a maxima binary
(for non-commercial purposes).

Well, running lie symmetry calculations(SYMMGRP), clisp is slower by at least a

Three years ago, I hacked up Maxima to run on ACL.  It is not the
current version (I think it was 5.4).  The basics work, and I use it
from time to time for small computations.

A couple months ago I passed these changes on to James Amundson, and I

still not work?  What remains to be done?

SBCL only runs on Linux/x86 and Alpha.  CMUCL runs on Linux/BSD x86
and Solaris/Sparc.  Older versions run on HPUX and SGI.
Unfortunately, the main developers don't have access to other
machines, so they've lagged behind.  I also understand that a
potential commercial version of CMUCL runs on Linux, sparc, and HP-UX,
with real OS thread support.

I think maintainability of the underlying lisp is irrelevant to maxima
unless you plan on maintaining the underlying lisp. :-)

My initial reaction is 3. In fact, I was more-or-less planning on it. I
even had the ACL free edition's restriction on dumping images in the
back of my mind when I designed the binary install structure.

I actually have the free edition on my disk, but I haven't tried Maxima
with it.

I used Liam's code to help with general ANSI issues, but I didn't put in
changes en masse. The current CVS version of Maxima should be close to
working with ACL, but I expect there would still be some issues.

There is a k_delta function which I used extensively

worked in Macsyma as follows:

k_delta(1,1); 1
k_delta(1,0); 0

There is a kdelta in the Maxima documentation, but I could
not get it to work.  Is there anyone who knows to

I do not think that damping GCL support is really good idea.
First of
all we do not have so many Lisps readily available as base Lisps
to
Maxima and I'm not sure what will happen to any of them in
future.
Having just three viable (some of them barely viable at present)
alternatives is really minimal number to fill safe.

As for performance. I have Maxima running on gcl 2.3.8, gcl
2.4.0, clisp
2.27,
cmucl 2.4.17, cmucl 18c on one Linux machine with 384Mb RAM and
Pentium III 733MHz CPU.

In all my tests clisp is 2-3 times (not 30% !!!) slower than gcl
and
cmucl.
The performance of gcl and cmucl is approximately the same but
fastest is gcl 2.4.0 with gmp support. Note that with gcl I pre
allocate
large chunk of ram at start since without this gcl slows down
substantially.

Sorry, I don't quite grasp your idea. In particular difference
between 1 and 3. Do you suggest to make Allegro CL
the primary Lisp for Maxima? If so then I would rather
support options 3. Any extra Lisps are welcomed and
I honestly believe that Allegro Common Lisp is better
than non commercial Lisps we have. But I don't like
to rely on any closed source binaries. Imagine the
company which provided them ceased to operate
(like Macsyma Inc. does) where do I get new ones?
Maxima is attractive to me due to availability of
complete source code (including Lisp) which doesn't
depend on any vendor.

I'm confused.  What are we arguing about here?  Maxima already has the
ability to export to LaTeX syntax, and presumably that ability could be
extended to other formats.  Whatever display we use, can't we just do
internally whatever is most convenient for display purposes, depending
on the interface?

I'm not really familiar with this solution - how would that work on
various platforms?  The only Display Ghostscript I am aware of is
http://www.gyve.org/dgs/ which has not been developed, apparently,
since 2000, is not finished yet and is part of the GNUStep project. Can
this provide an interactive interface?  What would be a good place to
start learning about this?

While were at it, Richard, I noticed in "A Review of Macsyma" you
mentioned some sort of interface that had been developed at Berkeley
provided  "a menu-based command structure on top of
typset-display-based local version of Macsyma", and MIT had somehow
prevented the sharing of the code among users.  Is that interface still
around?  Would it be of any use in the current problem?

Since I have an ACL Enterprise license, I can volunteer (as time
permits) to test the code, if this is the piece that's missing.  Is
there a regression test that is used to test Maxima?

On a related thread, it seems there is an idea among some people that
there is/ought to be one "official" CL to be used with Maxima that is
supported and everything else is secondary.  Completely unrelated to
Maxima, I write my CL code to ANSI specs whereever possible, to be
used with multiple compilers, and carefully isolate (with #+ #-)
whatever cannot be written to ANSI-CL.  Is this not an achievable goal
for Maxima as well?  I know it's hard given the long history of
Maxima, but it should be possible.

In summary, why does an ACL (or for that matter LispWorks, Corman,
etc.) port preclude CLISP, CMUCL, etc.?  Free vs. nonfree CLs seems a
non-issue.  

Liam

I agree completely.  ACL should be explored as another lisp on which to
run, but not THE lisp on which to run.

There used to be programs  intopois and poissimp.

They seem to be broken in the Maxima I have.

Right now there is a program in maxima called displa   which takes any
maxima expression and produces a 2-dimensional fixed-width character
display on a page of width  $linel  or less.  This defines the typesetting
"semantics" in a completely deterministic way.  The program can be
changed to put in variable-width fonts and special characters like
alpha, with very little work.  It is not obvious to me that you could
mark up a maxima expression to insert "a little more space" somewhere.
I don't know if MathML would be any better in terms of this level
of markup.  LaTeX allows extra spaces with marks like ~.


The reasons not to use LaTeX are those I mentioned previously.

1. LaTex cannot do line-breaks as well as the computer program
that understands math.
2. LaTex does not have the possibility of allowing selection from
its display  (i.e. draw a box around a subexpression and use that
as input to a command).
I suppose there are other problems like:
3. Installing LaTex can be tricky.   I find it very irritating to
here from someone "try my free software X" and discover that to
use it I must first find and download and install Tcl/TK, GCL,MikTeX,
python, Perl, emacs21, new fonts, etc.

Given all this, I DO use macsyma to produce TeX, and I paste
the results in papers.
But usually I just use the fixed-width typewriter display for my
own understanding.

Does Display GhostScript run everywhere? Is it available in source
form? Can it be linked to a running Lisp system?

Hello I write program for calculating Jordan cannonical Form,and etc.
  
  diag([a1,a2,..])							
  each ai is square matrix or one element.					
  Jordan cell JF(labmda,n),labmda is eigenvalue,n is size of matrix. 	
  jordan(mat) is jordan form but represented by list.			
  we obtain matrix form ,dispJordan(this list).				
  minimalPoly(this list) display minimalpolynomial of that matrix	
  (M^^-1)AM=JF,I soon show maybe at this week end			
  I intended to write this program,after saw Barton's mat_exp.mc 	
  Partially because of Mathematica BUG ,				
  a:matix( [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],						
         [1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0],						
         [-4,1,2,0,0,0,0,0],						
         [2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0],						
         [-7,2,0,0,2,0,0,0],						
         [9,0,-2,0,1,2,0,0],						
         [-34,7,1,-2,-1,1,2,0],					
         [145,-17,-16,3,9,-2,0,3])$	Mathematica returns wrong 
  Jordan form,my program returns correct answer for this matrix.
  please see
  http://library.wolfram.com/mathgroup/archive/2000/Dec/msg00108.html
 any opinion is appreciated.

I think that it will make some of our lives easier if
we say "download the pre-loaded Maxima/Allegro version for your system"
in response to "I can't compile GCL on Redhat x.y")
It appears that some participants are already planning
on compiling Maxima on Allegro CL.  I assume it will
not be difficult.  I did so a few years ago at Berkeley.

I understand the feeling.  However, I don't have sources
for Windows :) .

This might be uncomfortable, though Franz Inc has been in
business for something like 15 years, all of them
profitable.  This contrasts with Macsyma Inc, which
I suspect was never profitable.

In any case, I guess you'd still have the old software.

This referred to a MS project by Lilly Spirkovska at Berkeley;
it is not interesting to us anymore, I think.  It involved interprocess
communication between Lisp and a TeX/Display system, running on
a Sun system, requiring X11 windows.

It would have required distributing altered source code and was
therefore contrary to the technology transfer rights that MIT
gave exclusively to Symbolics.

Not likely to be of use. The last time I looked at it was
1990, and there was a long to-do list.

My assumption is that the person would not download the free version from
Franz, but a different (also free) version specifically for support
of Maxima, and perhaps with all of Maxima included.  I think it would
have to be less restrictive in various ways than the usual free
version.  I think that what has to be specified (by us) is a list
of necessary capabilities.  I assume that Franz Inc. would not be
happy with "just give us all the source and all the pre-compiled
binaries and all the rights to redistribute without limitation"
but we could ask for that:)
Or it could be that some group of people could be given full
"enterprise" copies but the version posted would be limited
somehow  (how?) as a courtesy to Franz Inc.

I agree; what would change your mind?  (Actually, I too have
an enterprise version at UC Berkeley, so there are a couple of
us for whom the production or testing of Maxima+Allegro is
already possible, but without some kind of agreement with Franz Inc
we can't really redistribute/post/ etc such a version.)

Good day,

There is a package for Macsyma that seem very interesting to me in that 
it "simplifies" expressions in a way that seem much more natural to me. 
(I think I've complained enough in the past about some of the 
shortcomings of Maxima.)

http://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/computer-algebra/

Could this be ever used with Maxima?


BTW some of you might be interested in noting that I went from "what the 
h*ll is this piece of cr*p" to using Maxima exclusively for my Computer 
Algebra needs (which are modest for the time being, but still).

Thanks!

Greetings!  This is just to let everyone know about a few GCL related
developments.  I thought I'd continue posting these to this list for a
little while, until the new gcl-devel list takes hold.

1) Web site up at  http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gcl/
	CVS tree imported from Dr. Schelter's last tree at
	utexas. Several patches uploaded.  
2) New list gcl-devel at gnu.org
3) I've backported a few items from gcl-2.4.0 to get a stable CVS
	build.  Will commit in a day or two after some testing.  This
	includes a patch Dr. Schelter sent me before he passed away,
	which for some reason never made it into CVS, and which
	cleared up segfaults on Debian systems.


How you can help it interested:

1) Please consider subscribing to the new list gcl-devel at gnu.org.  You
   can do this via the web at
   http://mail.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gcl-devel 

2) It would be wonderful if any interested parties could register at
   http://savannah.gnu.org and volunteer as a gcl developer.  Your
   patches/bug reports/testing results could be posted there for
   central reference.  Many items beside coding are needed, most
   notably testing and porting.  If anyone wants to use CVS write
   access, we could discuss this too.

3) Dr. Schelter seems to have been reworking the gmp support in the
   CVS tree shortly before he passed away.  Does anyone know what he
   was intending to do?  Scrap gmp?  Incorporate a smaller piece?
   Address malloc issues?  Any pointers/recollections most
   appreciated. 

Take care,

Greetings!  Believe me, I've been thinking a lot about this question
before deciding to volunteer for this.  In my mind, there is
sufficient reason to continue GCL, for the following reasons:

1) Very important that maxima have a *open*, non-commercial, stable,
   and fast lisp on which to run.  IMHO, one can never count on
   corporations to safeguard the future of software, but an interested
   volunteer development effort can preserve working code at a high
   level of capability, and *for the primary benefit of the users, who
   are often the coders* over a long period of time.  This saves us
   all a lot of effort by preserving the investment we expend in
   learning to use the software in the first place.  I learned
   emacs/gcc, etc. in grad school 15 years ago, and am still reaping
   the benefits of the time I put in doing so.

2) As compared to Clisp, GCL is much faster, and is likely to remain
   so due to its design.

3) As compared to cmulisp, GCL is potentially much more portable, and
   is likely to remain so due to its design.

4) In sum, it really just boiled down to the design of GCL.  Compiling
   to C, and relying on C compilers to provide speed and portability
   is just a good idea, IMHO, and I'd hate to see that wasted.

Take care,

Would this version be able to compile new user-written maxima code or
would it run interpreted?  Nothing I do with maxima really takes long,
so running interpreted isn't so bad.  If compiled, then wouldn't Franz
really be giving away the complete system with compiler and all since
maxima gives access to the underlying lisp?

I'm just curious.  I don't use the free versions of Allegro, for no
particularly good reason.

How would Franz benefit by doing this?  Also, how much does ACL
cost, for a end user, without any university affiliation?
My feeling is, outside of a university, a x86 platform is the
most common platform for most of us, and Gnu/Linux the prefered operating
system.  I only have 2 reasons for using windows, first because I
have no linux driver for my free dsl modem and second because I want
to run Macsyma 2.4, to compare its results against maxima.

I would even consider paying for a copy of ACL, if it wasn't too expensive,
but my end goal is a symbolic circuit analysis system, which is free
and which needs to run in at least one cheap enviornment.

I just tried it in maxima 5.6 with gcl, and format seems to load and
function OK, but the demo file doesn't and some of the other stuff
doen't either. For format you have to comment and uncomment some stuff
in a couple of files - he mentions this in the README. 

Not so sure about clisp or cmucl - tried it on a clisp build I have,
but it failed with an error about printing an ERROR message.  This
could be due to my bizarre build at the moment, so we should probably
wait for 5.9 before we really go to work on it, but I agree it looks
very interesting.  

If you mean including it in the Maxima package itself, I'd say we
should check with the author to be sure it's OK with him, and then have
a few people debug it and put it through it's paces. The website seems
to indicate that format was produced as the product of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, and is thus not subject to
copyright, but I'll send him an email anyway.

Not bad!  (Also highlights why documentation is so important.)

Even the current trial version or student version compiles, it just doesn't
write out the compiled code to a "fasl" file so it can be rapidly loaded.
My guess is we would want to be able to compile files of lisp additions
to make fasl files to make the code load faster and run faster. The fasl
files are different for different architectures, but the ordinary lisp code
would load without change on sun/x86/hp/mac/ etc.   For what it is worth,
I believe that all x86 fasl files are the same (linux, windows).

Yes. Which seems odd to me.  That is, someone could take such a
free Maxima+Allegro and try to strip out the maxima code  (or for
that matter, just leave it there!) and run some other lisp program.
I assume there is some way of Franz not "giving away the store"
but I don't know exactly how.  But then the trial version pretty
much gives away the store and they still have a business.

I don't know. I think you call them up and they try to figure
out your situation and what the appropriate level of support/price
etc is.  Or maybe they try to guess how much money you have
to spend :)   but the ACL+Maxima should be free independent
of affiliation, otherwise it doesn't seem right to me.

I think that here at Berkeley, Windows is far more common than Linux.

In the Allegro Enterprise edition, you are given a "dynamic runtime"
(I think its called) license.  This permits you to distribute runtime
images I _think_ only for noncommercial purposes.  However, the images
are not complete - things are stripped out before the image is made,
including most notably the compiler.  The recepient can interpret any
random CL code to his heart's content, but there is no compiler.

More info can be had from Franz Inc.

Forgot about that.  But if I remember correctly, the compiler is also
pretty fast, and low-end machines are some 4-10 times faster than when
I last used the free ACL, so it may not matter so much to recompile
everytime you needed it.

Removing should be easy:  unintern all the symbols in the MAXIMA
package and GC. :-)  Then I can get more heap than before, and maybe
more than the free versions allow. :-)

I guess not having the file compiler and the limited heap is the
problem?  And maybe the need to get a new license periodically?

In any case, a prepackaged maxima+allegro would not be such a bad
thing, especially if you run on Windows.

I will try to get someone from Franz Inc to read through this
and make a more specific proposal about what would be
included.  I think that the Maxima system that is distributed
could be made without a compiler, though such a system would
be handicapped for further development.

Hi,

I think that I would be a bit bothered by a move to a non-libre lisp. 
I'd worry that Franz might at some time have a change of corporate heart 
which would leave us out in the cold, and I'd worry that I wouldn't be 
able to freely redistribute a complete, usable Maxima.  On the other 
hand, I won't be able to do any of the extra work that NOT using Allegro 
might burden the maintainers with, so I really can't fuss about it.

If we build anything significant on the whiz-bang features which Allegro 
has and which gcl and clisp  presumably don't, then it might be a very 
painful thing to try to move back if Franz decided that helping out was 
bad for their shareholders.  I completely agree with Prof. Fateman that 
we do not want to see Franz come to any harm, and we certainly couldn't 
fuss if they found that they must pull the plug some time down the road.

Here's a counter-suggestion:  Would it make sense to invite the Franz 
folks to contribute a few bits and pieces of Allegro, under the GPL, to 
gcl ( or clisp) and thus make it possible to run Maxima nicely on both? 
   In return we could promise active cooperation toward getting and 
keeping Maxima running on their lisp and ours.  This would mean having 
our lisp and theirs converge, in the areas which matter to Maxima; I 
suspect there would have to be a pretty significant subset in common. 
This would probably also entail getting away from non-ANSI, gcl 
dependent code in Maxima.

  My idea is that we would be getting a kick-start toward having a GPL'd 
ANSI CL and some nicely integrated graphics, and they would be getting a 
really nice computer algebra system that they could use as a selling 
point for Allegro.  Of course, this depends on our (probably with help 
from Franz) being able to identify a set of things which Franz could 
share without harm to their business, but which would make a real 
difference to us.

The advantage to this would be that the potential user base would expand 
to all the Windows, Mac, etc folks who have Allegro.  The disadvantage 
is that we'll still have to do a lot of work on a lisp.  I'm afraid that 
I'm using ``we'' to mean ``you guys'', since I don't yet  have the time 
or the lisp ability to help out beyond offering free advice.

I hope this helps,

Subject: [Maxima] why GCL,  what about Allegro


...snip...

I have explored with Franz Inc the possibility of
their providing a base of Allegro CL for Maxima
development.

Advantage:  supported ANSI CL on Windows, Mac OS-X, many
different UNIX and linux systems, many extras like
graphics, web support, etc.  (see franz.com).

Disadvantage:  it does not come with source code.
Disadvantage:  there will be presumably SOME restriction
on this so that they are not giving away their main
source of revenue free.  Yet this may not be much of
a restriction since Franz already gives away a rather complete
lisp free (minus some compiler features and maybe a
maximum memory limit, plus.. one must re-register periodically...).
The free "student" version does not
include (I think) the full compiler (just compiles in-core,
not producing files), and I think does not support
new foreign function linkages.  I think that both
these restrictions would have to be lifted to be
viable.

My guess is that it will be something like

the free lisp + enough extra resources to include all
of maxima code + enough free space to continue to make it
interesting.

I don't know how people here feel about this.
Possible reactions

1. Yes, let's do it. It makes our lives simpler.
     (We still need to understand what restrictions we
      can live with.)

2. No, only open-source GPL code allowed here.

3. It's just another Lisp, along with GCL etc to support.
Do it if you want to.

4. Something else.


If you are inclined towards reaction 1, we still
need to make our list of "non-negotiable demands".
They must be such that Franz Inc's business is
placed in jeopardy.  If we use this code it is
in our best interests that the company remain profitable.

Hello,
 
the FORMAT package works with Maxima (I include it in Symaxx by default).
Only the installation is a bit tricky. My way of getting it to work (which
may or may not be the easiest way) is to copy the files to a location, where
Maxima finds then, and then to 'compile_file' format.lisp and coeflist.lisp
once by hand.
When this is done, the package is loaded with 
loadfile("format.o")
loadfile("coeflist.o").
 
Test it for example with
format(expand((x+y)^6),%poly(x)).
 
Regards
 
Markus

But among all the university computers only a few are used for 
technical problems.  

I can offer this estimate somewhat better adapted concerning the OS 
of choice of potential CA users. 
We monitor Web pages announcing an astronomy Winter School.  
Typical visitors are PhD astronomers, that is rather young people 
from developed countries frequently dealing with applied math.  
After 2,084 total hits, we obtain the following OS frequencies:

UNIX (Linux)             40.36%   841
UNIX (SunOS)             30.76%   641
UNIX (Other/Unspecified)  7.63%   159
Windows 98                5.28%   110
Windows 95                3.45%    72
Windows 2000              3.41%    71
Windows NT                2.88%    60
UNIX (HP-UX)              2.83%    59
Unknown Platform          2.26%    47
Windows 16-bit            0.67%    14
Macintosh (PowerPC)       0.48%    10

It is clear that the OS of choice for > 80% of such scientifically oriented 
users is Unix, with a dominance of Linux.

Of course this estimate could be improved by targeting the audience closer 
to real CA users.

I think that we have to be sure that what we get will work now
and for the indefinite future.  That is, as far as anyone can tell,
the code we get free does not expire.  (Of course changes in
OS make this harder than we would like, but what can we do there?)

I doubt there is much along these lines that we could use
  Some features probably
rely on proprietary features of the Allegro implementation, and so would 
not simply be pieces of common lisp to be revealed. In the case that it 
is just "more lisp", they already give out pieces of code like their 
lisp-language web server, which I think is on sourceforge.


>   In return we could promise active cooperation toward getting and

Probably this makes sense to them, but it is not much to offer.  My 
guess is that what we have to do is make sure Maxima is ANSI CL, and 
probably that would make it run on Allegro.  Convergence would mean our 
making GCL or whatever, more like ANSI CL.

It is always possible to have conditional code, and may be advantageous
  when there is an ANSI CL way of doing things and a super-clever 
efficient way in a particular dialect.

Since Franz Inc already rejected the idea of buying Macsyma Inc
outright, it's clear they don't see this as a great selling point in 
their current market;  if there is a new market for algebra systems in 
lisp, then this project, with their cooperation, will make that market 
rather unproductive: all the Maxima users will get a free lisp!


As I said before, I don't really understand the financial motivation, so 
I am assuming it has to do with some kind of good will towards maxima 
users.
After this semester, I will perhaps have some time and will just compile 
the maxima source to see what happens.  It used to work (older Allegro, 
older Maxima).  I don't think we have to do much.

Hi,

 I thought I would put in my two cents worth on the GCL/Allegro debate (or
whatever you wish to call it)!

 I would very much prefer staying with a free Lisp implementation of some
kind, for a couple of reasons that have already been raised, primarily:
*	What if Franz decides to back out of any deal, with detrimental
results for Maxima?
*	Free Lisp implementations are just that - free.
The latter point does matter, even in a corporate environment such as the
one I work in.  Getting funds for new software may not be an easy matter.
Finally, I think it is quite desirable to have the ability to compile Maxima
on different platforms, under different Lisps.  Otherwise, you might risk
alienating people.  With regard to platforms (i.e., operating systems),
there are situations where people, such as myself, are constrained to use
Windows, although the availability of Cygwin alleviates this somewhat (but
not completely).

 I should say that I can see the _desirability_ of using Allegro (having
used it myself once), but there may be too many strings attached...

 All the best,

 Dave Holmgren

Maybe this is a rather  silly question.

How can I export an expression, or a matrix, directly to C ??
 
I just want to copy and paste my expressions, in special matrices,
into a C program.

I know that the fortran routine works nicely for fortran programs but
I would like to minimise the trouble of converting from fortran to C.

I think you have to specify what you want..
do you want a sequence of assignment statements?

If so, try something like


for i:=0 to 10 do  print ("m[",i,"]=", stringout(m[i]),";")

  I don't know what you want to do regarding fortran vs. C.
maybe x^2 becomes pow(x,2)?
What problems are you facing?

There is a *huge* distance from such a simple program to real typesetting.
Have you read The TeXBook carefully? I have. It would take a lot of effort
to implement these algorithms. TeX solves a very complicated nonlinear
optimization problem. Development and fine-tuning of these algorithms took
many "Knuth-years". I doubt if we have another Knuth on this mailing list.

I still have to see at least one program which can do line-breaking in
typesetted maths. This is just too complicated problem. TeX cannot say in
advance how much space will be occupied by some formula. Therefore, it has
no possibility to decide if it has to break it or not. Trial-and-error
approach (typeset on one line; if it's too long, break it) is unacceptable
for efficiency reasons.

This is because you use Windows. If you just install any recent Linux
distribution, you will have all this stuff, and a lot more. (Well, Emacs
21 is too new to be in a distribution. Just
./configure
make
make install
By the way, I installed GCL 2.4.0 on RedHat 7.0 in exactly this way.

> Does Display GhostScript run everywhere? Is it available in source
> form? Can it be linked to a running Lisp system?
I don't know. Probably, this is too complicated solution. This was my
reply to a very specific question: how to use PostScript for display?
Ordinary PostScript is not well suited for this purpose. It runs the code
for the whole page without displaying anything; the command showpage
displays the page, but then you cannot update it. NeXT has developed some
extensions of PostScript which made it possible for applications to
communicate with their display server (it was not X) in this extended
PostScript language. There is an extension of (the most widely used)
PostScript interpreter GhostScript which implements these display
extensions. It is used in GNUStep, which seeks to emulate NeXTStep on top
of X. I never used GNUStep, and don't know much about it. Maybe, display
extensions are already in the mainstreem GhostScript sources. Newest
versions of GhostScript are available, for free and with sources, from
some company (it used to be Aladdin, but they changed their name). But
they are not free software, there are some restrictions on redistribution.
Older versions are re-licensed under GPL.

Apart from the question how to display PostScript, there is the question
how to generate it. There is a good free program, lout, which translates
its own typesetting language directly into PostScript (not via dvi, like
TeX). It seems to take a little simpler approach than TeX. However, this
is also quite a large program, which was developed for many years.

Best wishes,
Andrey

I've uploaded some changes to CVS, which produces a successful build
on 386-linux, and produces a gcl on which maxima passes all its
tests.  Will verify the dynamic linking working properly, but it
certainly should, as the patch that addresses this has been tested in
the Debian maxima package for a long time now.  

I'm hoping that other people's problems relate to this dynamic linking

Dear Maxima-ers on Mac OS X,

I am new to this list. I have just downloaded the cvs and tried
the new build procedure in for59 directory on Mac OS X to see
if it works.

I have an installation of clisp-2.27, which is the lisp I used.

- "migrate" worked fine.

- bootstrap complained that aclocal and automake does not exist.
That was true even after Developer Tools from Apple are installed. Since 
I have
failed to make automake-1.5, I fetched automake package in Darwin
1.2 and did the standard ./configure;make;sudo make install. Then,
bootstrap seemed to work fine. You can obtain the automake from
the following address.

http://www.opensource.apple.com//projects/darwin/1.2/source/other/automake-1.
4-1.tar.gz

- "make", then "sudo make install" worked  fine.

- Finally "maxima" just worked fine for me.

Everything went well, except for the aclocal and automake on Mac OS X.

Might have to wait a day for the backup to have the changes I

This is a little beyond version 2.4.0.  It is based on the latest cvs
of Dr. Schelter, which had a few bug fixes, and it now appears from
the logs, claims to have resolved the relocatable gmp problem.  I'm
trying to check into this to verify my understanding of these

I'd appreciate a look at it.  Vadim, perhaps you?

I think that quality typesetting from TeX requires some hand corrections
in some cases, so even TeX is not a perfect solution.  On the other 
hand, for visual display on a screen, TeX is probably too good (it has a 
higher resolution than necessary) and also not good enough, because of 
line breaks and feedback.

I have not read the TeXBook recently, but the algorithms are available 
in Pascal, C, and in Lisp:  there are two implementations, neither of
  which I can find right now.  Someone in France wrote a TeX in Lisp, 
and Bill Schelter wrote a TeX mode in the Texas Instruments Lisp Machine 
system (an extension to the emacs-like editor).  Schelter's program was, 
I think, something like TeXmacs, but only for the Lisp Machine.  I do 
not know where the code for this might be, or how close it is to the 
Common Lisp of today.

1. I don't think it has to be fine-tuned as much. At least if we are 
doing this automatically.  If we want to allow human hand-tuning of the 
result of computing, then I propose that we don't have to do anything.
We already have maxima --> LaTex.  A perfectionist can modify the LaTex 
code, and redisplay it.
2. The dynamic programming algorithm used by Knuth is available in 
carefully documented source code, if it makes sense to use it.  I don't 
know that it affects mathematical displays very much.  It matters more 
when you are typesetting a paragraph with relatively few places for glue 
(in-between words).  In math you have glue very often, like almost every 
symbol, and I think humans are less sensitive to minor differences in math.

There are several: Mathematica, Maple, (commercial) Macsyma, and even 
the free Maxima, if you allow fixed-width display in 2D to count as 
typesetting.

It is actually not so  difficulty to get a very good approximation to an 
optimal solution.  The same exact problem occurs and has been solved by 
Lisp pretty-printing programs. (Printing an indented version of a lisp 
program given a particular line-width). A naive solution takes time 
exponential in the size of the program to be displayed.  A cleverer 
solution takes (usually) linear time, and sometimes n^2.

We could require that Maxima users must have RedHat 7.0, or some
  other standard Linux, but to tell people "you use Windows, you lose"
is probably a bad idea :)

There is another way of typesetting which can be set up, and works like 
this:  you come up with an expression you wish to display.  You open up 
a connection to a typesetting program on the internet.  Send the 
expression.  The typesetting program sends back a GIF.  This may seem 
crazy, but actually it exists, and I have been using it for experiments.
Look up MINSE and glyphd
http://web.lfw.org/math/

Perhaps it is significant that I have been connecting to MINSE from a 
lisp program..

It doesn't solve the problem of line-breaking, nor does it, at the 
moment, give feedback/ subexpression selection.  The author of MINSE is 
a grad student at Berkeley, and some other students have looked at it. 
Advantage:  you don't need TeX etc AT ALL on your computer.
Disadvantage: you need to be connected to the internet!

I am not particularly advocating this solution.  I imagine the best 
solution to be finding Schelter's old Texmacs equivalent, all in lisp, 
and see if that works and can do line-breaking etc. and use emacs21, 
when it works for display in windows as well as linux. But this is 
speculative.

I would expect that generating postscript directly from the Maxima
displa program would be easy, but I agree that doing "batch" ghostscript
is not ideal. And what could be done is take the back end of the 
ghostscript interpreter, the part that looks up font shapes and sprays 
bits on a screen, is the significant part:  if that exists in a machine 
independent form it represents a useful piece of the solution...

I agree completely. TeX formatting algorithm is quite tricky
especially
for math. Each glyph in TeX's mathematical font have lots of 
extra parameters
which are requited to produce really fine output. I've tried once
to use
some ps fonts with TeX. At first result was perfectly ugly and I
spent
lots of time tuning some font parameters to achieve reasonable
quality.

On the other hand we have a good counter example. I mean
graphical
frontend for CAS Reduce. It exists on both Windows (psllw.exe)
and
X-Window (Xr). It doesn't use TeX fonts but just standard symbol
fonts which are present on every Windows or X installation.
It accept input in TeX (actually some subset of  TeX) and prints
it on screen with quite reasonable quality. I guess that they use
some simplified TeX's formatting algorithm. And it is good
enough to produce on screen output. But if you want really
good printed document you can process it by TeX.

Message-ID: <1B67F4AC-F246-11D5-8E90-00050217559F@mac.com>

Dear Maxima users,

I am relatively new to this list, so if this is well-known, please 
forgive me.

As posted yesterday, I have mostly successfully installed maxima on Mac 
OS X 10.1
using the new install procedure in for59 directory. Unfortunately I 
found that the
maxima that was installed could not go through some of the tests in doc 
directory.

My environment: clisp2.27, latest maxima in CVS, built with for59 
procedure,
Mac OS X 10.1, iMac266MHz with acceleration card of G3-450MHz.

Specifically, rtest2.mac, problem 29 failed. Error report by clisp:
*** - FUNCALL: MULT is a macro, not a function
1. Break [1]>

I have actually found that todd-coxeter.lisp defines mult as a macro. 
This is somewhat
dangerous since simp.lisp also defines mult, however, as a function. 
Though I haven't checked the Common Lisp manual to see how bad this is, 
I am sure either mult should
better be renamed to something else to avoid any confusion.

BTW, this is not an issue when maxima-pre59/src/compile-clisp.lisp is 
used to
create maxima. I haven't figure out why things work fine in that 
configuration.
Most likely the order of loading simp.fas and todd-coxeter.fas may have 
something
to do with this bug.

Does anyone with other platform (such as clisp on Linux) experience the 
same
issue? Can anyone using Mac OS X 10.1 reproduce the same bug?

Unclear what you have in mind.  You can define a maxima
function with a variable number of arguments, all evaluated,
this way:

f([x]) := x    /* note the [x] */


try  f(a,b,c);

To get pieces out of this x, use part, inpart, subscripting, first, rest
etc.

If you want to access from lisp, you should be able to do
(elt $x 0 ) -->  (mlist simp)
(elt $x 1)  -->  $a

etc.


At the time Macsyma was first being written, there were many ways
of defining functions with different argument evaluation techniques.
These techniques were  expr  (the usual), fexpr, lexpr,    and some
others.  These may still be in macsyma as
mexpr, mfexpr, and perhaps some other variations.
Esssentially all these other variants were incorporated in
common lisp in other ways, including &rest arguments, and defmacro.

There are also ways of defining macros using buildq  which I heartily
DISrecommend using.

If you wish to have a common lisp function that takes a variable
number of arguments I suggest you try

(defun f(&rest x)  x)   ;;; x is a list of the arguments, evaluated.

Would it be possible to modify displa to make it output a set of TeX subformulas, 
to be displayed one under the other, instead of the set of 2-dimensional 
displays? For instance, if we ask Maxima to compute 1000!, the result is 
displayed as 16 lines (i.e. as 16 "2-dimensional displays" of 1 line each for 
this simple case), and displa might output a set of 16 TeX subformulas ? (trivial 
refinement : allow  larger value for width  $linel, to take into account the fact 
that TeX display might be more compact than standard Maxima display) 

This way, we could benefit at the same time from the ability of Maxima to split 
long formulas (as compared to TeX's inability to split them) and the ability of 
TeX to produce beautiful output (as compared to limited ability of Maxima) ?

Hi,

I am aware of the problem you are seeing. It is not specific to OS X.
Instead, it's a side effect of the new build system. It should be fixed
soon.

Or the TeX display might be narrower, as in 2-columns.  Basically, the 
formatting
program in Maxima needs to compute the maximum width in points (or other 
typesetting
measure) of each subexpression, and compare to the line width of the 
eventual
device that will be used to display  (NOT necessarily the command 
window), and
then decide on that basis whether to
insert a break.  By the time this can be computed, all the computation
for typesetting the expression exactly as TeX would typeset it,
namely the size and position of each
character, is known.  You ask then that all this information be discarded
and that it should be recomputed by TeX.

Some approximation can be used, but it will not save much time.  By the way,
I know of no accepted way of displaying multiple-line integers, so there is
no TeX standard for displaying 1000! etc.

Another point that caused problems in the past for me, but perhaps
is now fixed? I recall trying to typeset

(a+ b+ .... c+d)
As 2 Latex commands,

(a + b +

   + c +d)

But encountered problems:  Tex REFUSED to do this because   $\bigl(a + b + $
is not balanced.  This does not seem to be a problem in latex2e, but maybe
there are other, similar problems?
   A better solution to large typeset expressions may be to use arrays of
aligned formulas.  However there are various buffers in latex that sometimes
run out of space.

   There are always tradeoffs between using someone else's program and
writing one that solves exactly the problem you have in mind.  Sometimes
NIH  (not invented here) syndrome is a waste, but sometimes it is right.

My recollection was almost correct:

Actually, latex refuses to typeset  $$ \left(a + $$
I get this:

! Missing \right. inserted.
<inserted text>
                 \right .
l.13 $$\left(a+ $

so maybe you can typeset \bigl(  which specifies some particular size

So (I am not sure I understand the sentence?), do you think it might be feasible,

Yes you are right, this is a good point. One ought probably have to write a 
generalized procedure that produces correct TeX output from incomplete formulas 
with unbalanced parenthesis. I could propose add "\left." to the left and 
"\right." to the right, either systematically (brute force) to each subformula or 
more intelligently, by examining if there are unbalanced parenthesis and adding 
either "\left." to the left, or "\right." to the right of each subformula when 
necessary. The brute force way does display correctly:

\scrollmode
$$ \left. \left(a + \right. $$
$$ \left. +b \right) \right.$$

Yes of course, you are right, a second approximation in refinements would be to 
use arrays of aligned formulas, although I imagine this would bring some extra 
difficulties if the notion of page would have to be used (for printed results?)  
rather  than strip of fixed width and indefinite height (during interactive 
computations) ?

No, if independent lines are produced ; Yes, you are right, it might happen with 
veeeery long arrays of aligned formulas, I suppose.

Yes, I quite agree. I think (dream?) that, if producing Maxima output as several 
TeX subformulas is easily feasible, it would provide, with Emacs and imaxima.el, 
an interesting interface for Maxima : formulas computed by Maxima -> transformed 
on the fly by TeX into bitmaps -> included as bitmaps in Emacs "� la imaxima.el". 
This would be especially interesting if the outline mode of Emacs could be used 
to display only a few images / formulas (is it ? by the way, Emacs 21.1 is 
available for Windows, now).

I apologize for not making this clearer:

1. It could be done in Lisp.  To do it accurately you would
have to implement almost all of math-mode TeX in Lisp.

2. If you have done this much work in Lisp, it would be
very easy to complete the job and not use TeX at all.
That is, the Lisp could produce DVI or some other form.

It is like driving the distance from Orleans to Paris
to measure how much petrol you need for the trip. Then
returning to Orleans, buying the petrol, and then driving
to Paris.

Subject: [Maxima] History of Macsyma - first draft
Message-ID: <20011217194524.64706.qmail@web12201.mail.yahoo.com>

I've tried to hunt around and make some kind of sense out of the
history of Macsyma for the user manual, working largely from Dr.
Fateman's papers, the odd usenet posting, and some communications from
Richard Petti.  I've included my first draft, and appeal to those who
where there to point out inaccuraces, omissions, etc.  (I know I need
to include citations - I'll fix that up for the final version.)  If
someone wants to take this as a start and write up a proper history,
please do - I know this is not very detailed and may be inaccurate in
some respects.


A Brief History of Macsyma

The birthplace of Macsyma, where much of the original coding took
place, was Project MAC at MIT in the late 1960s and earlier 1970s. 
Project MAC was an MIT research project, sponsored by the Advanced
Research Projects Agency(ARPA), Department of Defense, under Office of
Naval Research. The contract, which undoubtedly means something to
someone was N00014-70-A-0 362-0002. This project was blessed to have a
group of brilliant coders working in the "Mathlab Group".  They were
studying the possibility that
computers could be used to solve symbolic mathematical problems, a
challenge which at that time had never been undertaken.  The
undertaking was a sequel to a previous effort at MIT called Mathlab.
The new effort was dubbed Macsyma - Project MAC's SYmbolic MAnipulator.
(Cite new paper)  The original core design was done by W.A. Martin, C.
Engelman, and J. Moses in July 1968, and coding began in July 1969 with
significant parts of the system being programmed and designed by 
W.A. Martin, P. Loewe, T. Williams, R. Fateman, E. Tsiang, P. Wang, J.
Golden and others. This was long before the days of personal computers
and cheap memory - development was centered around the group's
DEC-PDP-10, running the ITS operating system.  This central machine was
the hardware core of the effort, and in its earliest years Macsyma ran
only on this machine.  It could be accessed remotely from Arpanet, a
precursor to the Internet and World Wide Web, which helped it gain a
wider audience. As the effort grew in scope and ability the general
interest it created lead to attempts to "port" the code - that is, to
take the series of instructions which had been written for one machine
and operating system and adapt them to run on another,different system.
 One of the very earliest ports, if not the earliest, was the running
of Macsyma in a MacLisp environment on a Honeywell Multics mainframe,
but due in part to the subsidized time on the MIT machine not much
effort was put into porting the early days (Computer time in those days
was measured out like the limited resource it in fact was, and the cost
of computer time on these machines could be very expensive - hence the
preference for the PDP-10.) The maintenance system was quite casual by
the standards of a modern software project, but without the instant
communication we take for granted today  (many contributing individuals
did not have access even to Arpanet) things were manageable.  

Around 1980, the idea of porting Macsyma began to be more interesting,
and the Unix based vaxima distribution, which ran on a Lisp environment
written in C, demonstrated that it was both possible and practical to
run the software on less expensive systems.  Once the code stabilized,
the new version opened up porting possibilities, ultimately producing
at least six variations on the theme which included Macsyma, Maxima,
Paramax/Paramacs, Punimax, Aljbar, and Vaxima.  These have followed
somewhat different paths, and most were destined to fade into the
sunset.  The two which survived obscurity, Maxima and Macsyma, we will
discuss below.

There is a certain surprising aspect in this multiplicity of versions
and platforms, given how non-portable the code originally seemed, but
it was helped along both by gradual efforts of many people and the
introduction of the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  While not everything
in Macsyma can be done in ANSI CL, the trend toward standardization
none the less made many things simpler.  It is a trend the Maxima
project is planning to carry on, to maintain and expand on this
flexibility which has emerged.

With all these versions, in recent history there are two which have
been major players, due this time more to economics than to code
quality.  1982 was a watershed year in many respects for Macsyma - it
marks clearly the branching of Macsyma into two distinct products, and
ultimately gave rise to the events which have made Maxima both possible
and desirable.  MIT had decided, with the gradual spread of computers
throughout the academic world, to put Macsyma on the market
commercially, via Arthur D. Little, Inc.  This version came under the
auspices of Symbolics Inc., which turned the project into a significant
commercial effort.  They hired away some of the MIT people to work
at Symbolics in order to improve the code, but they did not release any
of their changes back to the community.  The original PDP-10 also went
off the Arpanet in 1983. (Interestingly, the closing of the MIT Lisp
and Macsyma efforts was a key reason Richard Stallman decided to form
the Free Software Foundation.)  Between the high prices, closed source
code, and neglecting various platforms in favor of Lisp Machines (a
product of Symbolics which worked natively in Lisp) pressure came to
bear on MIT to release another version to accommodate these needs,
which they did with some reluctance.  The new version was distributed
via the National Energy Software Center, and called DOE Macsyma. It was
from this version that most of the distributions listed above were
developed.
The code was very definitely not free - the licenses ran in the
neighborhood of two to three thousand dollars, with the key difference
that with the license came the source code.  Among all the new activity
centered around DOE Macsyma, Dr. William Schelter began maintaining a
version of the code, calling his variation Maxima.  However, by this
point in the game, Macsyma was no longer a solo player in the field. 

 In 1988, Stephen Wolfram introduced his computer algebra system 
Mathematica, and in the same year? Waterloo Software released Maple. 
These systems were inspired by Macsyma in terms of their capabilities,
but they proved to be much better at the challenge of building
mind-share.  To the Macsyma user the proven, stable system seemed to
offer many advantages over these new systems. Needing a correct, tested
system with available source code more than they needed a GUI or fancy
formatting, they did not switch. Unfortunately for the Macsyma
community, the new systems proved that there was an enormous commercial
market for the closed, but perhaps more intuitive environments, and the
non-computer-science academic community also showed a willingness to
use these systems. DOE-Macsyma, because of the nature of its users and
maintainers, never responded to this challenge - it had no real need
to.  Symbolics, however, proved unable to cope with the new
competition.  In 1992 Richard Petti founded Macsyma Inc. by buying
their version of the program, with the intention to make it a viable
competitor to Mathematica and Maple.  Unfortunately, despite graphical
improvements, improvements in ability, and attractive pricing, the
battle was already lost.  When commercial efforts failed, R. Petti
attempted first to gain an endowment to permit continued development of
the system, and then to persuade Florida State to adopt Macsyma as an
addition to their symbolic mathematics software program, but both
efforts failed.  In the summer of 1999 Macsyma Inc. was sold to a
holding company, which is seeking large contracts for the product and
has removed it completely from the retail market.  The other DOE
Macsyma based efforts did not have Macsyma Inc.'s graphical interface,
or any visible market share.  Mathematica and Maple appeared to have
vanquished Macsyma.

It was at this point Maxima entered the game.  Although it was not
widely known in the general academic public, W. Schelter had been
maintaining and extending his copy of the code ever since 1982. He had
decided to see what he could do about distributing it more widely.  He
attempted to contact the NESC to request permission to distribute
derivative works.  The duties of the NESC had been assumed in 1991 by
the Energy Science and Technology Software Center, which granted him
virtually unlimited license to make and distribute derivative works,
with some minor export related caveats.  

It was a major breakthrough.  This release was granted in Oct. 1998,
just prior to the collapse of the commercial Macsyma effort.  When the
company abruptly vanished in 1999, with little to no warning or
explanation, it left their customer base hanging.  They began looking
for a solution, and some drifted toward Maxima, the only remaining
active and available version of the original Macsyma project and now
released under the Free Software Foundation's General Public License. 
The fact it was free both in terms of source code and price was
appealing to many, and it also attracted some new users who were
looking
for mathematical software without the high price tags of Mathematica
and Maple.

Dr. Schelter maintained the Maxima system until his untimely death in
July, 2001. It was a hard and unexpected blow, but Schelter's obtaining
the go ahead to release the source code saved the project and possibly
even the Macsyma system itself. A group of users and developers who had
been brought together by the email list for Maxima decided to try and
form a working open source project around the Maxima system, rather
than let it fade - which is where we are today.

Likewise.

Otherwise, a nice brief history of Macsyma/maxima.

The original idea, first voiced by Marvin Minsky, was to
automate the kinds of manipulations
done by mathematicians, as a step toward understanding the
power of computers to exhibit a kind of intelligent behavior.

YOU LEFT OUT THE LISP MACHINE IMPLEMENTATION!!!

During the years ??? a group at MIT designed and implemented a machine
which was based on the notion that hardware support of Lisp would make
it possible to overcome problems that inhibited the solution of
many interesting problems.  The Lisp machine clearly had to support Macsyma,
the largest Lisp program of the day, and the effort paid off with probably
the best environment for Macsyma to date (although requiring something
of an expert perspective).  Lisp machines, as well as other special
purpose hardware, tended to become slow and expensive compared to
off-the-shelf machines built around merchant-semiconductor CPUs, and
so the two companies that were spun off from MIT (Symbolics Inc, and LMI)
both eventually disappeared.  Texas Instruments built a machine called
the Explorer bases on the LMI design, but also stopped production.

including a unique operating system
but in fact Berkeley's building a replica of the Maclisp environment on 
the MIT-ML
PDP-10 using tools available in almost any UNIX/C environment, helped.
Complicating the matter was the eventual demise of the PDP-10 and 
Maclisp systems
as Common Lisp (resembling lisp-machine lisp, influenced by BBN lisp and
researchers at Stanford
Carnegie Mellon University.  It seemed sensible to retarget the
code to make it compatible with what eventually became

the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  Since almost everything needed for

 Arthur D. Little, Inc.  This version was sold to the
 Symbolics Inc., which, depending on your perspective,

either turned

the project into a significant marketing effort to 

help sell their high-priced lisp machines, or was a diversionary
tactic to deny their competitors (LMI) this program.  At the same
time MIT forced UC Berkeley (Richard Fateman) to withdraw the
copies from about 50 sites of the VAX/UNIX and VAX/VMS versions
of Macsyma that he had distributed with MIT's consent, until some agreement
could be reached for technology transfer.

been recoded in a dialect of lisp written for the VAX at MIT
called NIL. There was never a complete implementation. At about the same
time a VAX/UNIX version "VAXIMA" was put into the same library by Berkeley.
This ran on any of hundreds of machines running the Berkeley version of VAX
Unix, and through a UNIX simulator on VMS, on any VAX system.

 The DOE versions formed the basis of the subsequent non-Symbolics distributions.

a significant fee ($1-2k?).  It provided full source, but in a concession

to MIT, did not allow redistribution.  This prohibition seems to have

didn't recoup its costs!

There were, from the earliest days, other computer algebra systems
including Reduce, CAMAL, Mathlab-68, PM, ALTRAN, and others.  More serious
competition however did not arrive until Maple and Mathematica were
released, circa 1988.

 Symbolics, and its successor Macsyma Inc, having lost market share and

unable to meet its

expenses, was sold

in the summer of 1999.  The purchaser withdrew Macsyma from the market and the developers

and maintainers of that system dispersed.

partition(x,x) causes the following error, isn't this well defined?

partition(x,x);
x is an incorrect arg to PARTITION

It took less than one hour to figure this out and
do it, but it is rough around the edges.  I still
have to read how to make a "dump" of the system.

I had to recall that there is a file  dump-excl
(excl is "extended common lisp", previous designation
for Allegro).

This is different from defsys, which does not
seem to be in Allegro.

There are many warnings and stuff, some of which
presumably are relevant for other compilers, but
which perhaps are less informative.  I have
posted this on my web page as 
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/maximalog.txt

More later.


(I get a command prompt and can do x+x,  integrate(1/x,x) etc.

For this work my main sources were Richard Fateman's paper A Review of
Macsyma, some of the original Macsyma papers from MIT, and some Usenet
discussions which were opened up when Google extended their archive
back a decade or so.  Since Richard himself has kindly read over and
edited my draft, I think the new version should probably not have too
much trouble in this regard.  Richard, having been there all the way,
can I think be safely regarded as what historians like to call a
"primary source." That was one of the purposes of my putting this
version up for comment - I had to piece it togeather from what few bits
and pieces I could dig up, which wasn't a whole lot.  It's kind of
surprising how little information is readily available.

>Likewise.

In this case, I can cite a usenet post by Richard Petti, who until the
sale was the head of Macsyma Inc., and a similar email I received from
him personally when I wrote him asking what had become of the company
and its product.  (That was before the usenet post had been put up.)  I
know usenet isn't the greatest place to have to work from for a
history, but in this case since I have essentially the same information
sent directly to me, I think it's credible.  The key usenet post is
here:

http://groups.google.com/groups?q=macsyma+Petti&hl=en&scoring=d&rnum=4&selm=97rfu2%24o7a%241%40bob.news.rcn.net

OK, I'll just stick to dates then - I'll never be able to figure out
all the names that should be there, and I don't want to run the risk of
leaving anyone out who should be there.

Whoopsie.  Yeah, that wouldn't be good.
 

Thanks very much for taking the time to read over this, Richard.  You
filled it out and corrected it as I would never have been able to do.

Great. I'm glad to hear that Allegro doesn't require much work.

I think you want (excl:dumplisp :name "maxima.dxl"), but I don't have a
real version of Allegro with which to try it.

I learn something new every day. I've seen excl in various places, but I
did not realize it was the old name for Allegro.

I think it is feature.
The description of  partition in documentation doesn't look as
rigorous mathematical definition so it is not clear why parttition(x,x)

is considered as erroneous. On the other hand I can se _some_
rational behind this. This expression is nether product nor sum nor
list.
I guess partition will produce error for any atomic expression.

Dear Maximers,

I have recently noticed that my maxima on clisp2.27 failed to complete

different answer.

Is a well-known issue? How can I fix maxima so that this test returns OK?

Dear Dr. Dan Stanger,

I just noticed that:
	for u IN x do print(u);
works fine while
	for u in x do print(u);
does not.

Capitalizing both letters looks important. Certainly this should be
a bug...

Violating the suggestion that "if it ain't broke don't fix it"

I suggest nevertheless that the maxima code be changed
to all lower case (except for comments, character strings,
and other deliberate capitalizations).  This makes it
compatible with Allegro common lisp's  both-cases, built-in
names in lower case, "modern" mode.  It should not break
anything in the other common lisps.  It makes the code
easier for humans to read and (in the case below), easier
to write!

Dear Richard Fateman,

Oops, I am not trying to say that  he should change his maxima code
from "for u in x do ..." to "for u IN x do ...". I just posted my 
observation
so that others may find the reason of the bug and fixes.

I am trying to track down this bug. What I have learned after the last
post is that if you do (C1) as follows, the "for u in ..." can be 
repaired.
(C1) :lisp (setf (get '|$in| 'UPCASE) '$IN)
(C2) for u in [1,2,3] do print(u);
1
2
3
(C3)

I have looked into commac.lisp and found that the funcation 
bothcase-implode
needs (setf (get '|$in| 'UPCASE) '$IN) to work properly for keywords 
such as
for, in, and do in this case.

I am still trying to figure out where this (setf (get ... 'upcase) ...) 
is performed
for symbols such as 'for' and 'do'. (maybe putprop is used instead of 
setf and
get). I need some more time to understand this part of the source code.

Is there any document of the internal structure of maxima?

It must be adding bigfloats wrong!

I've just installed gcl 2.4.0 and maxima 5.6 (from the tarball, not
CVS). Things seem be working fine, except for integration. Here are
some examples:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(C1) integrate(sin(x),x);
Division by 0
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)
(C2) integrate(x,x);
				    2	   2
				   x  FALSE
(D2) 				   ---------
				       2
(C3) integrate(1/x,x);
(D3) 				    LOG(x)
(C4) integrate(1/x^2,x);
					  2
				     FALSE
(D4) 				   - ------
				       x
(C5) integrate(x,x,0,1);
					 2
				    FALSE
(D5) 				    ------
				      2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I understand D3, but none of the others. I've seen integration
problems mentioned in the list archives, but no solutions. Any
suggestions as to how I can fix this?

Strange, I just tried it and I get correct results.

I'm using this rpm (was too lazy, to build from sources)
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/symaxx/maxima-5_6-1_i386.rpm

Subject: [Maxima] Need help with share, etc.
Message-ID: <1008990959.2020.2.camel@abacus>

Everyone,

The two most important parts of the 5.9.0 release will be the new build
system and the moving/renaming of files. The former is basically
complete. I have run into a snag with the latter, however. I could
really use some help.

My problem is with the shared code. Right now it exists in the
directories share, share1, share2, sharem, sym and tensor. (Is there any
I missed?) The distinction between the shareX directories is arbitrary
as far as I can tell. I count no less than 62 different file extensions
in them. I sat down to attempt to standardize the file extensions
according to the proposal Vadim made quite a while ago:

> It is good idea to standardize this better
> and reduce the number of file extensions to, say,
> .mac .lisp .usg .mac .dem.

When I looked closer I found that this is a highly nontrivial task. Even
within the 62 file extensions, the usage is not consistent. For example
some .mc files are maxima batch files (which I would rename to .mac) and
some are lisp files (which I would rename to .lisp). Clearly, it is
going to be a big job to sort these out.

Here are the points on which I need help:

1) Someone needs to go through and figure out a mapping from the old
file names to new file names with consistent endings. It will be
tedious.

2) Unless someone has a better suggestion, I would propose to put
combine all the share-like directories in to one directory called
"share". "sym" and "tensor" would become subdirectories of "share". I'm
not terribly happy about this, but I don't have a better idea. Please
either come up with a better idea, or convince me that this idea is good
enough.

3) I have no idea what fraction of the packages in the share directories
are working, used, or even useful. Any input in this would be
appreciated.

Really, any help on the share file problem will be appreciated.

--Jim

P.S. I'm about to go out of email contact for about a week and a half.
I'll try to at least look at the email archives in my absence. 

P.P.S. I have the testing suite incorporated into the new build system.
Nearly all tests were working until the minute I was about to commit
them. (Shoot me now.) I will commit them after I return.

Here are some small additions to mactex.lisp which I find useful. If
nobody has objections, they should be, probably, included.

By mapping, do you mean a general rule which can be used for a script,
or just do them all by hand?  If we only have to do it once, it might
be more work to make a script then to just rename the darn things.  Or,
if the system I suggest below is agreeable, we might adopt the system
of once we move something out of untested, it gets renamed to fit the
extension conventions.

Here's a modified/improved version of a proposal I sent in a while back
on this problem - it's not great, but it might let us get somewhere and
would be slightly more organzied than jamming everything in share. 

Scrap the share system completely and instead have three directories -
extensions, untestedextensions and nonworkingextensions.  extensions
would be for packages which are tested and working. Nonworking could
hold things like the share2 vect package, which apparently isn't
working right now but we don't want to get rid of - basically for
unmaintained stuff which isn't stable or usable. untested would be
where everything would start out, and as each package is verified to be
working or not working we can move it to the appropriate directory,
renaming in the process.  It's probably idle to hope we can do much
more than rename the files and test a few before 5.9 - the job is just
too big.  This way, we would have a system in place, and as we
gradually work our way through the mess we would know what the status
of something is by virtue of where it is.  It's not ideal, of course -
the best way would be a huge testing bing to see if they are all
working, but that's way beyond our resources.  We might want a
directory in the future for incomingextensions, as people contribute
new stuff, but I suspect it will be a while before we have to worry
about that in a big way.

I'm sure this is getting the cart before the horse, so to speak, but
I've been playing around with ideas for a GUI to maxima, or more
specifically how to handle the idea of pressing buttons to get specific
mathmatical templates, and I thought I'd throw this out to start people
thinking about what kind of graphical interface they would want.  I've
attached pdf file that contains a line drawing of my envisionings.

I suggest copying the Mathematica arrangement, which,
I think groups stuff by Applications/Algebra... etc

and the distinction between types of files and working/notworking
be secondary.

Alternatively, you could have a duplicate  src/Applications
but that seems less convenient since some of this would

Subject: [Maxima] Successful recreation of maxima 5.5 windows install file (not compile, but install)
Message-ID: <20011222202412.27854.qmail@web12206.mail.yahoo.com>

This doesn't solve the Windows compile issues, or exactly how to make a
xmaxima binary, but it does address the problem of how to make an all
in one file for installing Maxima on Windows.

Using the InnoSetup program I mentioned earlier, I took the Maxima 5.5
binary that already exists, and successfully packaged it up.  The new
install process looks much more like a normal Windows install.  I have
tried it several times on a Windows machine I have access to, and so
far it seems to have worked fine.  If anyone has a machine that has
never had Maxima installed before, that is a case I haven't checked
yet.

I uploaded the file at
http://maxima.sourceforge.net/maxima5.5betasetup.exe if anyone cares to
test it out.  Be warned that this is a test, and while it seems to work
on my machine there is no guarantee with something so untried.  If it's
as smooth elsewhere as it is on my machine, this should be good for
future releases.

Subject: [Maxima] Re: Maxima digest, Vol 1 #158 - 15 msgs
References: <200112131730.fBDHUF722433@dell3.ma.utexas.edu>
Message-ID: <000c01c18b27$e16a25a0$0300a8c0@cah0>

Since I have received no response from
anyone on item no. 7 posted by me
in Vol. 1 #158, I thought that it best that I should
download GNU-Linux and GCLisp to
roll k_delta function myself.

But the installation procedures for
GNU-linux and GCLisp look
so daunting that I thought it best if I
used AutoLisp from AutoCAD under
Window OS.  This I could get working
easily and I have heard that this Lisp
is based on Common Lisp.  Has anyone
any experience in using AutoLisp for
this purpose?

Message-ID: <200112230147.RAA27382@galaxy.CS.Berkeley.EDU>

Do I understand that you propose to take all of
maxima and recompile it so that you can define
k_delta?

I think this would be a tremendous waste of time.

If you are just using autolisp to try to write
a small function to debug it, that might make
sense, but even so, not really. There are several
very good free lisps already compiled for a
variety of platforms, for example at franz.com.

This is known problem with GCL. Probably You have compiled GCL
with gcc 2.96. Rebuild it with gcc 2.95 and everything will be fine.

Strangely enough output cells have
too few lines and Maxima output
does not fit in it.

What am I doing wrong?
And what is the proper place for emaxima.lisp file?
Shall I place it in a directory where Maxima
looks for *.lisp files or it must be placed in the
sane directory with emaxima.el?

Subject: [Maxima] bug in for on pre59 built with clisp using cygwin
In-Reply-To: <3C25DF99.9BD08948@mail.ru>
Message-ID: <D47D35AE-F7CB-11D5-A1F8-00050217559F@mac.com>

Dear all,

I have found the reason of the bug that Dan Stanger has encountered.
This is somewhat a complex bug for which I can propose several solutions.

Let's take an example which will be used through out the explanation.
for u in [1,2,3] do print(u);
1
2
3

This does not work in clisp2.27 and the latest maxima. Because the
word 'in' is not properly converted to the symbol $IN.

The function bothcase-implode defined in commac.lisp performs this
conversion. For the keyword 'in', the conversion takes place in the
following way: (#(J\(B$ #(J\(Bi #(J\(Bn) -> |$in| -> $IN . The logic in this function
works only when the symbol |$in| does not exist for the first time this
function was called with (#(J\(B$ #(J\(Bi #(J\(Bn) as its input. That first time,
(setf (get sym 'upcase) symup) is executed only if the symbol |$in|
does not exist. Second time and later when the function is called
with (#(J\(B$ #(J\(Bi #(J\(Bn) as its input, 'upcase' property is used to do the
right conversion.

The above condition does hold for symbols such as |$for|, |$do| and
|$print|. However, it does NOT hold for |$in|. That causes the conversion
not to work for keyword 'in'. So, who defines this symbol?

If you take a look at mactex.lisp, then you see a function texmdoin
definition is:

(defun texmdoin (x)
   (nconc `("(J\\(Bmathbf{for}" ,(second x) $|in| ,(third x))
          (cond ((sixth x) `("(J\\(Bmathbf{thru}" ,(sixth x))))
          (cond ((null (seventh x)) nil)
                ((eq 'mnot (caar (seventh x)))
                 `("(J\\(Bmathbf{while}" ,(cadr (seventh x))))
                (t `("(J\\(Bmathbf{unless}" ,(seventh x))))
          `("(J\\(Bmathbf{do}" ,(eighth x))))

You see a symbol $|in| there in the definition. This symbol is same as
|$in|. This means that once mactex.{lisp,fas} is read, the symbol starts
to exist. To confirm, you may change $|in| to something like |$anything|
and reload the file. Then the example
for u in [1,2,3] do print(u);
does work fine. (Oh, of course this is not a solution since generated tex
source will be mangled.)

So, some solutions are:
(1) to modify texmdoin in mactex.lisp to avoid using a lisp symbol to
generate a TeX source text. It should be achievable only using strings.

(2) to modify bothcase-implode in commac.lisp so that it does not care
the prior existence of a symbol such as |$in|.

(3) In some place, just execute (setf (get '|$in| 'upcase) '$IN) so that
the logic in bothcase-implode works and conversion takes place.

I would suggest (3) for a temporary solution and do a serious rewrite
of bothcase-implode function later at some time. Any suggestions?

Some note:
- Though bessel.lisp defines function name $in, the symbol $in and
|$in| are different and bessel.lisp has nothing to do with this bug.

- Vadim V. Zhytnikov has pointed out that GCL performs things well.
This may have something to do with the how common lisp symbol
intern works on GCL and clisp. Since I don't have GCL at hand and
Mac OS X is not a supported platform for GCL, I cannot test it.
It would be of some help if someone do:
(eql '|$in| '$|in|)
and tell me the result.

Greetings and a Merry Christmas to All!

It seems to me there is a bug in tests.lisp. 
I compiled maxima-pre59 against gcl-2.4.0 (RH6.0).
All tests works fine except rtest4.mac.
After 71 problem I have 

"Using ratsimp
Polinomial quotent  is not exact
-- an error ...."
I checked this test manually step by step and it works fine!
Then I replaced the new "tests.lisp" by one from maxima-5.6.
And all tests were passed without errors.

best luck

Valerij

This is due to bug in gcl 2.4.0. Use gcl 2.3.8beta3 or
cvs from new gcl development site at Savannah.gnu.org.

Thank you, Vadim!
Indeed, maxima-pre59 compiled with cvs version gcl gives no errors on "make test"

I definetely prefere (2) but it might be tricky. And the hard part is not
the function itself but confidence that our modification do not
break some other piece of code. So maybe (3) is indeed
acceptable as temporary solution.

This gives T on both clisp and GCL.

Looks nice.
Just some extra thoughts about the project:

I'd like to have all left and right panels as floating panels.
They might be either docked to the main window
or detached as separate small windows. But I'm not
sure what any widget allows to do such things.

Is it _really_ important to have multiple canvas?
What is essential difference between having several
canvas or just having several maxima sessions
in separate shells? In general I do not feel that
running several maxima sessions simultaneously
is a typical situation.

Best wishes,

Vadim

Have anybody tried the facexp package?
It seems to me it's broken. For instance the function nulllistp(list) is nowhere defined
and still there are some more problems. batch(facexp,demo) stops with errors.

I think we have to work out some well defined list of file types
with unique (recommended) extension for each type. When we
achieve consensus about such a list it must be included in
documentation and Readme for reference.

Renaming concrete files to the new scheme it is another story.
It seems that it can't be performed automatically since at present
names are quite inconsistent. So we have to go and rename
each file individually.

I also started examining all these share files to make some
more concrete proposals but unfortunately I have _very_
limited spare time till the end of January.
But I'll try to do my best.

As for directory structure I think that one share directory with sub
directories
  /share
      /algebra
      /matrix
      /graphics
      /ode
      ....
is the most logical way to arrange things. It is very convenient
from the user's point of view and libraries in Maple and
Mathematica are arranged in similar fashion.

Subdivision of the style "tested/working/nonworking" seems to
me less important. Some packages may work on maxima+gcl
but fail on other lisps. But simple Maxima patches will
change their status. Some packages must be
used as source to work properly but it seems that there
are also others which must be compiled. Finally I
guess there are lot of packages which require just
few lines of change to make them work.

Maybe it is good idea to bring all share files to consistent
(lower) case together with renaming. But maybe it is too
much for now.

1. building maxima on autocad's autolisp (Richard J. Fateman)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, it is probably not a sound strategy to use AutoLISP for
the purpose I mentioned.  This is because it is an interpreter
which would require access to the lisp source-code.   My
problem would be completely solved if I could roll a kdelta
function definition for k_delta which performs exactly like that
in Macsyma 2.2.  Then I could supply this function to my existing
ebooks and epapers  in the appendix and recommend
readers to download Maxima instead.  Here is how k_delta
function performs in Macsyma 2.2+:

k_delta(1,1);     1
k_delta(1,0);     0
k_delta(0,1);     0
k_delta(true,true);     1
k_delta(true,false);    0
k_delta(false,true);    0

So far I have failed to emulate this exactly in a kdelta function
using compare(i,j) with filters.  Here is my kdelta function which
works partially:

kdelta(i,j):=block([args:args [i,j]],(compare(i,j)-pos)*(compare(i,j)-neg))
/((zero-neg)*(zero-pos))$

kdelta(1,1);     1
kdelta(1,0);     0
kdelta(0,1);     0
kdelta(true,true);     1
kdelta(true,false);    (PNZ - NEG) (PNZ - POS)/((ZERO - NEG) (ZERO - POS) )
kdelta(false,true);    (PNZ - NEG) (PNZ - POS)/((ZERO - NEG) (ZERO - POS) )

I tried evaluating the cells as you had written them, and didn't have
any problems.  It may have something to do with Emacs not waiting long
enough for Maxima output; I'll work on that (after the weekend,
unfortunately...)

Probably nothing.

The way it's set up (which I stole from imaxima) Emacs looks for the
file (I thought that for people setting up an Emacs program, it would
be easier...), so it should go in the Emacs load path, the same
directory as emaxima.el should work.

It was.  But I have a start. I don't know enough about some of the
stuff there even to know what to do with it, but for a lot of the files
I've got the desired name changes down.  I was working with 5.5beta,
since my copy of the newest cvs got corrupted when I tried to bring it
home - if there are any significant differences between the share files
of the two versions that'll have to be corrected for.  

I don't know exactly how this will fit into the migration pattern, or
even if it's exactly what you had in mind, but hopefully this will
serve as a guide for Vadim and others. I've included a list of the move
commands I was more or less sure of in the attached file.  Is the mac
directory part of this, by the way?  Also, there are a few other
directories which need to have decisions made about - books, deliver,
elisp and maybe one or two others.

books, if I am not mistaken, seems to contain Bill's Netmath files. 
deliver appears to be part of the old system for making a windows
binary.  elisp appears to be an old emacs mode - is this obsolete now
that Emaxima has entered the game?  Also, what is the o directory for?

Unfortunately, there were a lot of questions about things in share*
which I'm not qualified to answer or decide on - I've tried to list the
issues at the end of the email. Sorry this is so long.  Many of these
can probably be addressed quickly by someone who knows a little more
than I do.  Hope this is of some help.

A point of concern - if we change the share structure, however we
decide to do so, we need to make sure we know how to inform Maxima of
the change.  In looking at maxima 5.5, the list of share directories
appears to be hard wired - a grep finds both init_max1.lisp and the
saved_maxima file have this information present.  Is there anyway to
create a .maxima file, analogous to a .emacs file, which could contain
this information, allow for simple user change of it, and at the same
time allow the loading by default of user selected maxima packages? 
For emacs users this would be intuitive, and would certainly be
preferable to hard coded directory listings.  

One last point - is there some way we could make the Maxima system
sufficiently flexible so we could install it in an arbitrary directory
under Windows? Currently, as far as I know, it must be C:\maxima 

CY

share/

share.mc and share.usg are merely descriptive text files.
I'd recommend we combine them and merge them into the 
documentation effort.  These do confirm that share, share1
and share2 are all part of the same system.

fft.mil is an answer to an email question about fft.
recommend merging with fft.usg

bessel.usg does not appear to refer to a file currently
available in the share directories.

array.usg - the function this describes fails to load
with an error message.  Does not seem to be a file present
which corresponds to this file.

cgamma.usg does not appear to refer to a file currently
available in the share directories.

eigeni.mc appears to be an older version of eigen.mc, 
written for macsyma.  eigen.mc came about in order
to get this file to run on DOE Macsyma.  Need to figure
out what to do with the old file.

neither elec.dat or elec.plt loads in Maxima, or
has any apparent connection to any other file in 
share.  What are they?  

ellipt files - will these be replaced by the new elliptical
integral stuff? needs to be checked

fact.dft is only an example file of how to 
exponentiate a series - it claims that this
functionality is now build into TAYLOR, and
this file is now just for reference. 
recommend merging into documentation.

The only difference between fileop.lsp and fileop.mc is a character
on the end of the lisp file.  The mc file can probably be removed
as a duplicate, once it is established what the purpose of that
character is, unless something in the maxima code requires both.

It is not clear to me what gam.mc is or what is does - 
is it associated in some way with gamalg?

The file gam.usg appears to refer to the gamalg file.
Renamed accordingly

it's not clear from what's there, but it looks as 
if newton.mac is an expanded version of newton.mc
someone who knows more about this needs to look
over both files and see.

ode2.usg appears to refer to a file which is in the
mac directory.

plot2 does not appear to be present in Maxima.  Carrying
out renaming but if plot2 is no longer available we should
probably move these files to some sort of storage directory
for files which are no longer relevant

It appears plot2.rch and plot2.rcn are email archives
which discuss plot2.  Recommend adding them to the end
of plot2.usg

qualsp.mc is identical to qualsp.lisp.  Unless there is
some need on the part of the Maxima code, removing
qualsp.mc seems like a good idea (the file is lisp)

recur.tpt looks like a log of a sample session - i've renamed it to
recur.usg, but it is not proper documentation.

rombrg is now integrated into maxima - the dem and usg files
are still present.  They should probably be merged with the
main documentation.

Not sure what series.usg is associated with - needs to be figured
out. There is a series command in macsyma, not sure if they are
related.

simpsn.dem and simpsn.mcr are quite similar - need to figure out
the purpose of mcr file.

trgsmp.nls appears to be some kind of output from UNLISP?

trgsum is not a file in share - is it present in maxima?  If so,
files says it is autoloading, I'd recommend this be merged with
the main documentation.

Not sure what vect.rth is - needs to be figured out.


share1/


ai.lisp and ai.mc are virtually identical - one may be
removable

airy.usg refers to a file apparently not present in
share1  Needs to be checked out.

asymp needs to be checked out.  There is a file asympa.mc,
but I am not sure that is the file refered to by asymp.* files.
Just glancing through it, it doesn't look likely.
In any case, the demo files are renamed. The dmt file is
an example session, which I'd recommend adding to asymp.usg

I'm not sure if cfortr.tst is a necessary file or a
test file - the tst extension would seem to indicate
a test file, and it does have that appearance.  

deleta.dmo appears to be related to the file bad.  This in turn is
almost identical to a file delta.dem, except for the line which 
loads the delta package.  As I check, the file bad is identical 
to delta.dem. Hence I'd say delete bad and deleta.dmo - if the load 
is a problem the load form ofdelta.dmo can be restored in delta.dem

diffop.lsp and diffop.mc are virtually idenctical - one may be
removable

elim needs to be looked at by someone qualified - there are several
different
files with endings such as .LISP, .UNLISP and .lsp  which seem to have
different
content.  need to figure out which ones are the ones actually used. 
The same
case exists for the fourie files and the ntrig files.

note:  The file gamma.mac does not appear to be related to cgamma in
share

hypergeo doesn't seem to be present, but there is a demo file

intexs.mc - I'm not sure what this is - looks like it might
be a demo file of some kind.

there is almost no difference between permut.lsp and permut.mc -
one might be removable

sets doesn't seem to be present in Maxima - are files relevant?

sumcon doesn't seem to be present - tpt file appears to be a sample
session.  Recommend adding to .usg file.

share2/ 

recommend combining batch.dmc and batch.tpt files into batch.usg

bfac.lisp is out of date apparently - it recommends user to use bffac

bffac.bfz and bffac.lsp are similar, but there are extra lines in
bffac.bfz.
need help on this one.

cartan.str is quite close to the .dem file, but there are differences -
should be resolved

not sure what to do about disol.nls file - seems to be another UNLISP
file

recomend adding dskuse.tpt to dskuse.usg

elec.mc and elec.lisp almost identical

There is a long series of files starting with gam, of the form gam*.mc 
and gam*.lsp.  In each case, the .mc and .lsp files are almost
identical
This needs to be resolved.

recommend adding gendif.bgs to gendif.usg

If I'm not mistaken, kn.trl is an older version of kn.lisp
in the move commands I move it to kn_old.lisp

ndiffq.dmp is an empty file - recommend it be removed
unless needed for some reason by the package, which
unfortunately doesn't seem to be present in Maxima

recommend adding optmiz.tpt to optmiz.usg

recommend adding optvar.tpt to optvar.usg

polsol.usg seems to refer to a file not in share2
powers.usg seems to refer to a file not in share2
prrid.usg seems to refer to a file not in share2  (This one was
originally 
written by Dr. Fateman - maybe it's available somewhere in his
directory?)

revert.trl seems to be an older version of revert.lsp
mv revert.trl revert_old.lisp

someone needs to take a look at sqdnst.mcs and sqdnst.mc

not sure what to do about submac.snt

sharem/

in general, the .txt files in this directory seem to be macsyma
files almost identical to the .mac files - the differences should
be checked out, and if possible the .txt files removed or the .txt
files replace the .mac files.

also, there are unlisp files present for most of the packages
in this directory - need to figure out what they are for.

I have no idea what the clean.xfl file is - needs to be identified

not sure what defm.snt file is

sym/

tex files - this is a french
document, and the tex is quite old.  If it is still useful,
maybe the french documentation team can give us a hand translating
it and updating the LaTeX?

Most or all of the files in this directory are part of one
system, which is documented in the tex documentation.  It was
apparently written in Paris, and the version number is 01. I
have no idea what it is supposed to do.

doconline probably should be renamed to reflect what
it is describing

There is a makefile present - is this part of the general macsyma
build?
If not, should be checked out.


tensor/

There is too much there that I don't know about - someone has to figure
out what those files actually do, why they are named the way they are,
and how to work all that over into something that makes more sense.
The documents and papers should probably be combined, but there is a
lot of material there.

Same problem with Clisp.

    Richard> It must be adding bigfloats wrong!

After some poking around, I think the problem is in biglsh in
src/float.lisp, which I don't really understand what it's trying to
do.

However, if I replace fpshift with the following function which
doesn't call biglsh, the buggy results are gone.  This seems to be the
right thing to do since fpshift appears to be basically Lisp ash (for
a binary radix).

(DEFUN FPSHIFT (L N) 
       (COND ((NULL *DECFP)
	      (ash L N))
	     ((GREATERP N 0.) (TIMES L (EXPT 10. N)))
	     ((LESSP N 0.) (QUOTIENT L (EXPT 10. (MINUS N))))
	     (T L)))

I think biglsh is only called by fpshift, so we could probably delete
biglsh completely.

This is probably OK; biglsh seems to be attempting to avoid some
bignum construction.

Hi folks!

I'm just starting...

When I say

declare(x,integer);

then

integerp(x);

gives false.

Does this mean, that integerp(x) is intended to give true if x is an
instance of an integer?

Thanks, Martin

No.
When a symbol is declared INTEGER, automatic simplifications can
exploit this fact.  For example, SIN(n*%pi) simplifies to 0 if n is
declared INTEGER.  A symbol can be declared INTEGER if it is known to
represent an integer.  INTEGER is a member of the FEATURES list.
It can be asserted with DECLARE, withdrawn with REMOVE, and detected
with FEATUREP.

(C1) declare(x,integer);
(D1)      DONE
(C2) FEATUREP(x,integer);
(D2)      TRUE

did you try ?substring("abcde",1,3);

probably it will be off by 1, since the string will
  be |&abcde|, at least that is what it is in the
commercial macsyma.


I'm not sure why you want eval_string.
  There is a macro-expansion
facility which involves buildq and related stuff.  I don't
know if it is useful to you, but the idea is you can
create a program in one step, and in the next,
evaluate it. Usually people don't use strings in lisp
to represent programs, since lists are so much better
supported.

1. Maxima digest, Vol 1 #166 - topic 1 (Webbooks)

I have taken a temporarily fix by using a function
definition for kdelta(i,j) as follows:

k_delta(i,j):=block([i,j,z:i-j],
if numberp(z) then
   (if is(z=0) then 1 else 0)
    elseif is(i=j) then 1 else 0)$

Outputs:
k_delta(1,1);      1
k_delta(1,0);      0
k_delta(0,1);      0
k_delta(true,true);   1
k_delta(true,false);  0
k_delta(false,true);  0

There are no error-traps for mixed entries such as:
k_delta(true, "hello") or k_delta(1,true) but I hope
that future upgrade of Maxima will supply this
function.

Message-ID: <000901c19190$cecdda80$0300a8c0@cah0>

Maxima digest Vol 1 #167 - messages 7 and 9:

The problem in Maxima:

(C1) declare(x,integer);
(D1)        DONE
(C2) featurep(x,integer);
(D2)        TRUE
(C3) integerp(x);
(D3)       FALSE

I found I could redefine Integerp(x) to yield TRUE using the
following function definition provided declare(x,integer) is
done first.

integerp(i):=block(args:i,if featurep(i,integer) then true else false)$

Integerp(x);  TRUE
Integerp(y);  FALSE

I feel strange that Maxima did not protest at my redefinition of
Integerp funciton.  Could anyone comment on it?

I found  that Maxima is rather weak on string processing.  
I regularly downloaded dna strings from genome databases
which are presented in string formats.   I have no 
problems in Macsyma converting strings to lists and 
vice versa but I have a problem with Maxima because
the getchar function and string_length function are  not defined.  
Here is what I did in Macsyma:

dnastring:"CGATATATATGAGAGAT";
CGATATATATGAGAGAT

dnalist:makelist(getchar(dnastring,k),k,1,string_length(dnastring));
[C, G, A, T, A, T, A, T, A, T, G, A, G, A, G, A, T]

Is there anyone who could suggest how I could do the conversion
from a string to a list.  Incidentally concat function is available in
Maxima which makes it possible to convert a list to a string but
why is this provided when other obvious string functions are not
provided?

Probably you should be writing in lisp.

In lisp, the string x="CGATATATA..."

is simply an array of characters, and can be addressed
as (aref x 0), (aref x 1), etc.

There are functions for concatenation, substitution, etc.


The macsyma program you write produces a lisp list that
looks like
  ((mlist simp) $C $G $A ....)

If you really want to use a lisp list, you can convert
a string to a list, perhaps using coerce.  or else
approximately the way you have written it in macsyma.

What is important to figure out is:  what parts of
the programming are
(a) hard to write
(b) need to run fast.

Usually these are different parts.


Although the programs you mention could be added to maxima,
I think it is worth pointing out that much of the later program
development was done on the basis of what users expressed
a need for, and what developers thought would be neat to
include.

hi Richard

I write this program according for your advise.
It's well doing but no gard.

(DEFUN $STR22LIS (X)
  
  (let ((list1 nil)
	(num (length (string X))))
    (do ((counter 2 (+ 1 counter))) ((> counter num) (cons '(mlist) (reverse list1)))
	(setq list1 
	      (if (equal 'T  (getchar X counter))(cons  "T" list1)
		(cons (getchar X counter) list1))))))
 
please save this in a file as Huen.lisp

 (C2) dnastring:"CGATATATGAGAGAT";  
 (C3) load("Huen.lisp");
 (C4) str22lis(dnastring);
 (D4)[C, G, A, T, A, T, A, T, G, A, G, A, G, A, T]
that's OK


Bytheway
I found memory leak!??at using?gensym().maybe this  caused
recent  question about ability with maxima.

thanks

Message-ID: <Pine.A41.4.40.0112310728460.70162-100000@unet.univie.ac.at>

Hi folks!

Although this is a bit early, because I'm very new to Maxima, I wanted to
get it out. I hope Maxima will be THE cas for me and lots of others, so
here are my proposals: (Please note, just ideas!)

[policy]
1. Maybe it would be good to get the mailing list a little organized? I
would
propose to use the following indicators (always in, say brackets)
[policy] organisation, goals, visions, etc.

[install] installing issues

[user] on using maxima

[devel] on developing maxima

[doc] on documentation

This would make it very easy for me to create a (monthly?) digest, if
wanted. More importantly, I could skip more easily those parts I'm not to
interested in.

(Yesterday I read the whole archive 2001. My wife is a little angry...)

-------------
2. How about a good and bads list:

Goods:

GPL

access to lisp -- what a wonderful language for doing maths! --
underneath, mathematica, maple don't have this!

doesn't (!) simplify automatically like mathematica does. This is a great
feature, because often I KNOW that some expression doesn't simplify.
Mathematica then still tries, takes quite some time (I had a case with 20
seconds per eval on my notebook) and then returns the input
nearly unchanged! It's important to me that the cas does exactly what I
tell it to do, no more!

wonderful interface to emacs that makes debugging easy -- Mathematica
doesn't have this!

highly portable on every layer (is this correct?)

very nice integrated doc (I like texinfo and describe!)

probably a lot more

Bads

doesn't use assumptions enough yet

probably a lot more

-----------
3. I like the name Macsyma better...

-------------

4. Lisps

I think the idea of Richard Fateman concerning the use of Allegro could be
exploited differently, too: Why not encourage (ask) Lisp vendors to
support maxima and gain a nice package for their users. "Support" could
be: contributing to the building procedure, bug reports, (conditional)
additions and maintainance to the kernel to make maxima run faster,
better, etc. with their lisp (no new features!!!)

I think it is very important to keep maxima running with as many FREE or
GPL lisps as possible (especially with gcl, because I like the idea of
maxima --> lisp --> c!) which probably means to make it as common lisp as
possible.

--------
5. I like the idea of having subdirectories working, nonworking and
untested. Why not add a standard comment on the first line of the package
or have directories

/share/algebra,...
/share/untested and /share/nonworking?

great! I'd add

/share/combinatorics

this really shouldn't happen too often after 6.0!

Let's see.

[Devel]
1. Question: aren't most functions (lisp files in src) really
packages, only written in lisp?(If I got things right, this doesn't make
that much a difference to maxima) I'd like the separation in a kernel and
packages! For example: I simply won't ever (ok, maby once a month) use
integration, diff,... so, if possible:

separate kernel (to be defined) and packages as much as possible

in the init file I tell maxima what I want to use always!

maybe this would help to maintain things.

2. I like the standard for a position in mathematica, i.e. -1 is the last
element in the list.

3. I like the idea of conversion, touched by Mr. Fateman and dan stanger
earlier this year. But I'd find it good to have it the other way to. So I
could do something in Maxima, and then look what Mathematica does with it.

(I'm talking of "simple" things like sums and Intgrals and the like, no
sophisticated macros)

[user]
1.
I don't quite understand dan stangers reply to my integerp question: He
writes

> No. When a symbol is declared INTEGER, automatic simplifications can
> exploit this fact.  For example, SIN(n*%pi) simplifies to 0 if n is
> declared INTEGER.  A symbol can be declared INTEGER if it is known to
> represent an integer.  INTEGER is a member of the FEATURES list. It
> can be asserted with DECLARE, withdrawn with REMOVE, and detected with
> FEATUREP.

What's IntegerP for, then, if it doesn't use features. I found it used
quite often in nusum.mc for example.


I feel, it should be there to test wheter x is an integer expression. So
Declare(x,Integer); IntegerP(2^n);
should give T.

If I want to test for a actual number, I would say
IntegerP(x) and NumberP(x);

By the way, what's the difference between assume and declare, in my
opinion,

declare(x,positive);

and

assume(x>0);

should really be the same thing...

(By the way, KIND is not known at my maxima, but I didn't get the latest
version yet!)
---------------
2.
I really like to use
[a,b]:[1,2];

instead of

a:1;b:2;

but it doesn't work in 5.6! does it work in 5.9pre?
----------
3.
Maybe I get my prof Christian Krattenthaler to have a look at the sym dir.
He knows french better than I do and schur functions a lot better then I
do. (But I'm working on both)

-----------

Sorry for the long list, but I had to fetch up now. And sorry for not
citing enough, I'm not too good with pine.

Happy new year!
(Guten Rutsch!)

I am sending in a couple of question relative to the simple user of
Maxima.

First of all I have no knowledge at all of Lisp and for the moment I
have no possibilities to learn this language, although I know of its
capabilities. 

Martin posed some interesting comments and I will reply them below.

I am still in the list because I understand that we need to create a
group of users which are between the developers and the common
users. These top users are the responsible to "spread the news of
Maxima" to the rest of the community. I am trying to be in this group 
before recommending the generalised use of Maxima among my students. 


The organization of the topics could be a good start, but  I feel that
other topics are more urgent to the non-developers group.

First, the first question a first user does is: can it simplify my
huge (or not so huge) expressions? I know that the answer is not so
easy and we must know what is "simple" for us. 

However, how to deal with this problems is being really tricky to
me. I could not find a paper or so, which could give some light to
this problem. I still have problems with trigonometric simplifications
generated by matrices multiplications ... While these and similar
problems have not enough documentation or hints or examples I cannot
recommend Maxima to users which will have greater problems than mine.

Other question is that installing newer versions is better when we
have an available binary such as .deb and .rpm for Linux and the same
for Windows. This turn easier we, from the list, to test newer
versions and submit bugs. I know that we can get the cvs but this is
an extra barrier to the installation of a newer (ans unstable)
version.

This is good, but solving only with the internal resources of Maxima
is better for common users.

I had the same experience with Mathematica, but now I have the
opposite problem: I wide number of possibilities to simplify but I
cannot find a the logic of  the simplifications. 

    Martin> wonderful interface to emacs that makes debugging easy --
    Martin> Mathematica doesn't have this!

This is really fantastic!

    Martin> highly portable on every layer (is this correct?)

At least all Unixes and Windows

    Martin> very nice integrated doc (I like texinfo and describe!)

Integrated and possibly incomplete! We need to aggregate the
documentation od the old Macsyma ASAP ..

    Martin>  3. I like the name Macsyma better...

Well, if the copyright problem is solved we can change the
name. However I think we need not to be stressed by this problem for
the moment.

Finally, thank you Martin for exposing your thoughts.

Bye,

Daniel
